abstract = {Two novel and simple mathematical models of arthropod temperature-dependent development are proposed. These models are easy to use and have 3 (equation 1) and 4 (equation 2) ecologically meaningful parameters, respectively. Each parameter can be estimated using nonlinear regression. These models were used to compare developmental rates at constant temperatures for our own experiments on Lobesia botrana (Dennis and Schiffermuller) and for data from 6 insect species described (a total of 13 stages). In all cases, we obtained an accurate nonlinear description of the rate of development against temperature given by the adjusted R2 (Kvalseth, 1985). The adjusted R2 calculated extended from 0.86 to 0.99 and were identical for our equations 1 and 2. In all cases, equation 2 provided the lowest residual sums of squares. The models gave upper T(L) and lower T0 temperature threshold estimations, and the estimations obtained were better by using equation 1 rather equation 2. Confidence intervals for each parameter were given and a comparison between estimated and observed temperature thresholds were presented.},

abstract = {Collective or group intelligence is manifested in the fact that a team of cooperating agents can solve problems more efficiently than when those agents work in isolation. Although cooperation is, in general, a successful problem solving strategy, it is not clear whether it merely speeds up the time to find the solution, or whether it alters qualitatively the statistical signature of the search for the solution. Here we review and offer insights on two agent-based models of distributed cooperative problem-solving systems, whose task is to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle. The first model is the imitative learning search in which the agents exchange information on the quality of their partial solutions to the puzzle and imitate the most successful agent in the group. This scenario predicts a very poor performance in the case imitation is too frequent or the group is too large, a phenomenon akin to Groupthink of social psychology. The second model is the blackboard organization in which agents read and post hints on a public blackboard. This brainstorming scenario performs the best when there is a stringent limit to the amount of information that is exhibited on the board. Both cooperative scenarios produce a substantial speed up of the time to solve the puzzle as compared with the situation where the agents work in isolation. The statistical signature of the search, however, is the same as that of the independent search.},

abstract = {Various aspects of the ecology of Lycosa carolinensis Walckenaer have been investigated in a Lower Sonoran Desert community, including surface activities, seasonal activities, and burrow construction. The average home range is {\$}1.1\backslash {\{}\backslashrm m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} and parts of the home range boundaries are proposed to be limited by changes in topographical relief. Adults and immatures are inactive from November through February. Immatures reach their highest percentage during the months of March and October. The peak percentage of females and males occur in June and July, respectively. Females have two peaks of egg sac carrying in late July and late August and can possibly have two broods of spiderlings per year. It is thought that females do not reproduce until the third summer and possibly live one year or more. Males also mature in the third summer, but die the year they reproduce. The burrows occupied by L. carolinensis serve as a retreat from heat, desiccation, and some predators. The burrows are randomly distributed with respect to each other but uniformly distributed with respect to shrubs. Most of the burrows have turrets (87{\%}), which probably function as an "early warning system." In the laboratory, 72{\%} of third, fourth, and fifth instar spiderlings construct burrows which they later abandon, giving rise to the possibility that the spider can possess at least two burrows during a lifetime.

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the response of metabolic rate to temperature is essential for understanding thermal ecology and metabolic adaptation. Although the Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the effects of temperature on reaction rates and metabolic traits, it does not adequately describe two aspects of the thermal performance curve (TPC) for metabolic rateâ€”that metabolic rate is a unimodal function of temperature often with maximal values in the biologically relevant temperature range and that activation energies are temperature dependent. We show that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate in ectotherms is well described by an enzyme-assisted Arrhenius (EAAR) model that accounts for the temperature-dependent contribution of enzymes to decreasing the activation energy required for reactions to occur. The model is mechanistically derived using the thermodynamic rules that govern protein stability. We contrast our model with other unimodal functions that also can be used to describe the temperature dependence of metabolic rate to show how the EAAR model provides an important advance over previous work. We fit the EAAR model to metabolic rate data for a variety of taxa to demonstrate the model's utility in describing metabolic rate TPCs while revealing significant differences in thermodynamic properties across species and acclimation temperatures. Our model advances our ability to understand the metabolic and ecological consequences of increases in the mean and variance of temperature associated with global climate change. In addition, the model suggests avenues by which organisms can acclimate and adapt to changing thermal environments. Furthermore, the parameters in the EAAR model generate links between organismal level performance and underlying molecular processes that can be tested for in future work.},

abstract = {Individually identified lions (Panthera leo) were observed on the open, semi-arid plains in Namibia. Data from 486 coordinated group hunts were analysed to assess cooperation and individual variation in hunting tactics. Group hunts generally involved a formation whereby some lionesses ("wings") circled prey while others (" centres ") waited for prey to move towards them. Those lionesses that occupied "wing" stalking roles frequently initiated an attack on the prey, while lionesses in "centre" roles moved relatively small distances and most often captured prey in flight from other lionesses. Each lioness in a given pride repeatedly occupied the same position in a hunting formation. Hunts where most lionesses present occupied their preferred positions had a high probability of success. Individual hunting behaviour was not inflexible, however, but varied according to different group compositions and to variations in the behaviour of other individuals present. The role of cooperative hunting and its apparent advantages within the semi-arid environment of Etosha National Park, Namibia, are discussed.},

abstract = {Cross-national differences in personality have long been recognized in the behavioural sciences. However, the origins of such differences are debated. Building on reinforcement sensitivity theories and gene-by-environment interactions, we predict that personality trait phenotypes linked to dopaminergic brain functions (centrally involved in reward processing) diverge most strongly in climatically stressful environments, due to shifts in perceived rewards vs risks. Individuals from populations with a highly efficient dopamine system are biased towards behavioural approach traits (Extraversion and Emotional Stability) due to higher perceived reward values, whereas individuals from populations with a less efficient dopaminergic system are biased towards risk avoidance. In temperate climates, we predict smaller phenotypic differences due to overall weakened reward and risk ratios. We calculated a population-level index of dopamine functioning using 9 commonly investigated genetic polymorphisms encoding dopamine transporters and receptors, derived from a meta-Analysis with data from 805 independent samples involving 127,685 participants across 73 societies or territories. We found strong support for the dopamine gene by climatic stress interaction: Population genetic differences in dopamine predicted personality traits at the population level in demanding climates, but not in temperate, less demanding climates, even when controlling for known correlates of personality including wealth and parasite stress.},

abstract = {Researchers studying the adaptive significance of behaviour typically assume that genetic mechanisms will not inhibit evolutionary trajectories, an assumption commonly known as the 'phenotypic gambit'. Although the phenotypic gambit continues to be a useful heuristic for behavioural ecology, here we discuss how genomic methods provide new tools and conceptual approaches that are relevant to behavioural ecology. We first describe how the concept of a genetic toolkit for behaviour can allow behavioural ecologists to synthesize both genomic and ecological information when assessing behavioural adaptation. Then we show how gene expression profiles can be viewed as complex phenotypic measurements, used to (1) predict behaviour, (2) evaluate phenotypic plasticity and (3) devise methods to manipulate behaviour in order to test adaptive hypotheses. We propose that advances in genomics and bioinformatics may allow researchers to overcome some of the logistical obstacles that motivated the inception of the phenotypic gambit. Behavioural ecology and genomics are mutually informative, providing potential synergy that could lead to powerful advances in the field of animal behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Researchers have observed large-scale neural meta-state transitions that align to narrative events during movie-viewing. However, group or training-derived priors have been needed to detect them. Here, we introduce methods to sample transitions without any priors. Transitions detected by our methods predict narrative events, are similar across task and rest, and are correlated with activation of regions associated with spontaneous thought. Based on the centrality of semantics to thought, we argue these transitions serve as general, implicit neurobiological markers of new thoughts, and that their frequency, which is stable across contexts, approximates participants' mentation rate. By enabling observation of idiosyncratic transitions, our approach supports many applications, including phenomenological access to the black box of resting cognition. To illustrate the utility of this access, we regress resting fMRI transition rate and movie-viewing transition conformity against trait neuroticism, thereby providing a first neural confirmation of mental noise theory.},

abstract = {Since the last decade, the collective intelligent behavior of groups of animals, birds or insects have attracted the attention of researchers. Swarm intelligence is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the implementation of intelligent systems by taking inspiration from the collective behavior of social insects and other societies of animals. Many meta-heuristic algorithms based on aggregative conduct of swarms through complex interactions with no supervision have been used to solve complex optimization problems. Data clustering organizes data into groups called clusters, such that each cluster has similar data. It also produces clusters that could be disjoint. Accuracy and efficiency are the important measures in data clustering. Several recent studies describe bio-inspired systems as information processing systems capable of some cognitive ability. However, existing popular bio-inspired algorithms for data clustering ignored good balance between exploration and exploitation for producing better clustering results. In this article, we propose a bio-inspired algorithm, namely social spider optimization (SSO), for clustering that maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation using female and male spiders, respectively. We compare results of the proposed algorithm SSO with K means and other nature-inspired algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO) and improved bee colony optimization (IBCO). We find it to be more robust as it produces better clustering results. Although SSO solves the problem of getting stuck in the local optimum, it needs to be modified for locating the best solution in the proximity of the generated global solution. Hence, we hybridize SSO with K means, which produces good results in local searches. We compare proposed hybrid algorithms SSO+K means (SSOKC), integrated SSOKC (ISSOKC), and interleaved SSOKC (ILSSOKC) with K means+PSO (KPSO), K means+genetic algorithm (KGA), K means+artificial bee colony (KABC) and interleaved K means+IBCO (IKIBCO) and find better clustering results. We use sum of intra-cluster distances (SICD), average cosine similarity, accuracy and inter-cluster distance to measure and validate the performance and efficiency of the proposed clustering techniques.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of temperature on biological systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072 thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 Â± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV.However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle - stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 Â± 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

abstract = {The temperature of chilled foods is a very important variable for microbial safety in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time. Predictive modeling is a promising field in food microbiology. Models are used to describe the behavior of microorganisms at different physical and chemical conditions, such as temperature, pH, and water activity. They can be used to predict microbial safety or shelf life of products, to find critical points in the process, and to optimize production and distribution chains. A major factor determining the specific growth rate of microorganisms in chilled foods is temperature. Various models have been proposed to describe this relationship. Spencer and Baines (16) proposed a linear dependency of the rate of microbial spoilage of fish on temperature. This relationship was shown to be valid only at temperatures below 6Â°C (8). Therefore, Olley and Rat-kowsky (8) proposed an Arrhenius (2)-type equation. This equation could predict results up to 15Â°C. However during cooling, freezing, heating, or thawing, regions in the product can have a temperature far above 15Â°C, and therefore a wider growth-temperature range is important. Schoolfield et al. (13) proposed a nonlinear Arrhenius type of model on a biological basis, describing the specific growth rate as a function of temperature over the whole biokinetic temperature range. Further empirical models were proposed by Ratkowsky et al. (10, 11), i.e., the square root model, describing the specific growth rate up to 15Â°C, and the expanded square root model, describing the growth rate over the whole biokinetic temperature range. A model which is only seldom used is the model of Hinshelwood (7), although it is a simple model with a biological basis. Adair et al. (1) modeled the growth rate and the inverse of the lag time using the Ratkowsky and Schoolfield models and concluded that the Schoolfield model gives the best predictions. The literature provides us with a number of models. However, a systematic approach to determine the most suitable model is lacking. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of the different models by systematic and statistical analysis of a large amount of experimental data. * Corresponding author. THEORY Description of experimental bacterial growth data. The growth curve is defined as the logarithm of the relative population size [y = ln (N/NO)] as a function of time (t). For bacteria, the growth rate shows a lag phase that is followed by an exponential phase, and finally it shows a decreasing growth rate down to zero resulting in a maximum value of the number of organisms. A growth model with three parameters can describe this growth curve (18): the maximum specific growth rate RLm' which is defined as the tangent in the inflection point; the lag time X, which is defined as the taxis intercept of this tangent; and the asymptote A, which is the maximal value reached. The three parameters are determined from growth data by describing them by the Gompertz model (6). Therefore, the Gompertz model (6), with parameters a, b, and c, was rewritten (18) to include A, PLm, and X [e = exp(1)]. Modified Gompertz: y=Aexp{\{}-exp[ im e (x t) +1]{\}} (1) Growth-temperature relations. A number of growth-temperature relations are compared. Included are models from the literature as well as modified forms. The models are all written with the growth rate as a function of temperature. Transformation of the growth rate (square root, logarithm) was not executed, as others tend to do (1, 4, 9, 17), to fit all data in the same way. Using transformations on data results in a different weighting of different numerical values. Using the minimum residual sum of squares (RSS) criterion, one has to take into account that a transformation changes the distribution of errors at different numerical values. If regression without weighting is used, the measuring error must be normally distributed with the same standard deviation at all different T values. The growth rate used is the PUm found with the modified Gompertz model. (i) Square root model of Ratkowsky et al. (11). This model does not have a biological basis. It is based on the observation that at lower temperatures the square root of the specific growth rate is linear with temperature (11):},
