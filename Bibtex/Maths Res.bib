abstract = {Tested the cumulative hierarchial assumption of B. S. Bloom's (1956) taxonomy by orienting 80 American and 52 Australian undergraduates at 4 taxonomic levels (Knowledge, Application, Synthesis, Evaluation) to the same study material and subsequently administering an unexpected memory test. With the exception of the Evaluation category, recall generally increased, as predicted, as taxonomic level increased. Bloom's taxonomy appears to possess some cross-national validity, at least for the 2 nationalities sampled, since the overall recall performance of the groups was quite similar. In general, moderate support was obtained for the cumulative hierarchical assumption, but it is concluded that the Evaluation category is misplaced as the apex level of the taxonomy.

@article{Rohrer2015,
abstract = {A typical mathematics assignment consists primarily of practice problems requiring the strategy introduced in the immediately preceding lesson (e.g., a dozen problems that are solved by using the Pythagorean theorem). This means that students know which strategy is needed to solve each problem before they read the problem. In an alternative approach known as interleaved practice, problems from the course are rearranged so that a portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems in an interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a strategy on the basis of the problem itself, as they must do when they encounter a problem during a comprehensive examination or subsequent course. In the experiment reported here, 126 seventh-grade students received the same practice problems over a 3-month period, but the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved practice or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded with a review session, followed 1 or 30 days later by an unannounced test. Compared with blocked practice, interleaved practice produced higher scores on both the immediate and delayed tests (Cohen's ds = 0.42 and 0.79, respectively).},

abstract = {For the gifted mathematics student, early mastery of concepts and skills in the mathematics curriculum usually results in getting more of the same work and/or moving through the curriculum at a faster pace. Testing, grades, and pacing overshadow the essential role of creativity involved in doing mathematics. Talent development requires creative applications in the exploration of mathematics problems. Traditional teaching methods involving demonstration and practice using closed problems with predetermined answers insufficiently prepare students in mathematics. Students leave school with adequate computational skills but lack the ability to apply these skills in meaningful ways. Teaching mathematics without providing for creativity denies all students, especially gifted and talented students, the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of mathematics and fails to provide the gifted student an opportunity to fully develop his or her talents. In this article, a review of literature defines mathematical creativity, develops an understanding of the creative student of mathematics, and discusses the issues and implications for the teaching of mathematics.

abstract = {Developing the connection between biology and mathematics is one of the most important ways to shift the paradigms of both established science disciplines. However, adding some mathematic content to biology or biology content to mathematics is not enough but must be accompanied by development of suitable pedagogical models. I propose a model of pedagogical mathematical biological content knowledge as a feasible starting point for connecting biology and mathematics in schools and universities. The process of connecting these disciplines should start as early as possible in the educational process, in order to produce prepared minds that will be able to combine both disciplines at graduate and postgraduate levels of study. Because teachers are a crucial factor in introducing innovations in education, the first step toward such a goal should be the education of prospective and practicing elementary and secondary school teachers. {\textcopyright} 2010 2010 The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {Teachers in the UK and elsewhere are now expected to foster creativity in young children (NACCCE, 1999; Ofsted, 2003; DfES, 2003; DfES/DCMS, 2006). Creativity, however, is more often associated with the arts than with mathematics. The aim of the study was to explore and document pre-service (in the UK, pre-service teachers are referred to as 'trainee' teachers) primary teachers' conceptions of creativity in mathematics teaching in the UK. A questionnaire probed their conceptions early in their course, and these were supplemented with data from semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the responses indicated that pre-service teachers' conceptions were narrow, predominantly associated with the use of resources and technology and bound up with the idea of 'teaching creatively' rather than 'teaching for creativity'. Conceptions became less narrow as pre-service teachers were preparing to enter schools as newly qualified, but they still had difficulty in identifying ways of encouraging and assessing creativity in the classroom. This difficulty suggests that conceptions of creativity need to be addressed and developed directly during pre-service education if teachers are to meet the expectations of government as set out in the above documents. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {This study compared three different methods of teaching five basic algebra rules to college students. All methods used the same procedures to teach the rules and included four 50-question review sessions interspersed among the training of the individual rules. The differences among methods involved the kinds of practice provided during the four review sessions. Participants who received cumulative practice answered 50 questions covering a mix of the rules learned prior to each review session. Participants who received a simple review answered 50 questions on one previously trained rule. Participants who received extra practice answered 50 extra questions on the rule they had just learned. Tests administered after each review included new questions for applying each rule (application items) and problems that required novel combinations of the rules (problem-solving items). On the final test, the cumulative group outscored the other groups on application and problem-solving items. In addition, the cumulative group solved the problem-solving items significantly faster than the other groups. These results suggest that cumulative practice of component skills is an effective method of training problem solving.},

@article{Cuoco1996,
abstract = {Thinking about the future is risky business. Past experience tells us that today's first graders will graduate high school most likely facing problems that do not yet exist. Given the uncertain needs of the next generation of high school graduates, how do we decide what mathematics to teach? Should it be graph theory or solid geometry? Analytic geometry or fractal geometry? Modeling with algebra or modeling with spreadsheets? These are the wrong questions, and designing the new curriculum around answers to them is a bad idea. For generations, high school students have studied something in school that has been called mathematics, but has very little to do with the way mathematics is created or applied outside of school. One reason for this has been a view of curriculum in which mathematics courses are seen as mechanisms for communi-cating established results and methods-for preparing students for life after school by giving them a bag of facts. Students learn to solve equations, find areas, and calculate interest on a loan. Given this view of mathematics, curricu-lum reform simply means replacing one set of established results by another one (perhaps newer or more fashionable). So, instead of studying analysis, students study discrete mathematics; instead of Euclidean geometry, they study fractal geometry; instead of probability, they learn something called data analysis. But what they do with binary trees, snowflake curves, and scatter plots are the same things they did with hyperbolas, triangles, and binomial distributions: They learn some properties, work some problems in which they apply the properties, and move on. The contexts in which they work might be more modem, but the methods they use are just as far from mathematics as they were 20 years ago. There is another way to think about it, and it involves turning the priorities around. Much more important than specific mathematical results are the habits of 375 376 CUOCO,GOLDENBERG,ANDMARK mind used by the people who create those results. We envision a curriculum that elevates the methods by which mathematics is created and the techniques used by researchers to a status equal to that enjoyed by the results of that research. The goal is not to train large numbers of high school students to be university mathematicians. Rather, it is to help high school students learn and adopt some of the ways that mathematicians think about problems. In broad strokes (with some details to follow in later sections), this includes learning to recognize when problems or statements that purport to be mathematical are, in truth, still quite ill-posed or fuzzy; becoming comfortable with and skilled at bringing mathemati-cal meaning to problems and statements through definition, systematization, abstraction, or logical connection making; and seeking and developing new ways of describing situations. Although it is necessary to infuse courses and curricula with modem content, what is even more important is to give students the tools they will need in order to use, understand, and even make mathematics that does not yet exist. A curriculum organized around habits of mind tries to close the gap between what the users and makers of mathematics do and what they say. Such a curricu-lum lets students in on the process of creating, inventing, conjecturing, and experimenting; it lets them experience what goes on behind the study door before new results are polished and presented. It is a curriculum that encourages false starts, calculations, experiments, and special cases. Students develop the habit of reducing things to lemmas for which they have no proofs, suspending work on these lemmas and on other details until they see if assuming the lemmas will help. It helps students look for logical and heuristic connections between new ideas and old ones. A habits of mind curriculum is devoted to giving students a genuine research experience. Of course, studying a style of work involves working on something, but we should construct our curricula and syllabi in a way that values how a particular piece of mathematics typifies an important research technique as much as it values the importance of the result itself. This may mean studying difference equations instead of differential equations, it may mean less emphasis on calcu-lus and more on linear algebra, and it certainly means the inclusion of elementary number theory and combinatorics. This view of curriculum runs far less risk of becoming obsolete before it is even implemented. Difference equations may fall out of fashion, but the algo-rithmic thinking behind their study certainly will not. Even if the language of linear algebra becomes less useful in the next century than it is now, the habit of using geometric language to describe algebraic phenomena (and vice versa) will be a big idea decades from now. At the turn of the 20th century, the ideas and thought experiments behind number theory (e.g., the decomposition of ideals into prime factors in number fields) was smiled upon as the pastime of a dedi-cated collection of intellectuals looking for the elusive solution to the Fermat conjecture; at the turn of the 21st century, even after Fermat has been settled,},

Behaviourism equates training with education, and a blanket adoption of such a philosophy for all of school mathematics misses the heart and essence of the mathematics discipline.

abstract = {We propose that the cognitive mechanisms that enable the transmission of cultural knowledge by communication between individuals constitute a system of 'natural pedagogy' in humans, and represent an evolutionary adaptation along the hominin lineage. We discuss three kinds of arguments that support this hypothesis. First, natural pedagogy is likely to be human-specific: while social learning and communication are both widespread in non-human animals, we know of no example of social learning by communication in any other species apart from humans. Second, natural pedagogy is universal: despite the huge variability in child-rearing practices, all human cultures rely on communication to transmit to novices a variety of different types of cultural knowledge, including information about artefact kinds, conventional behaviours, arbitrary referential symbols, cognitively opaque skills and know-how embedded in means-end actions. Third, the data available on early hominin technological culture are more compatible with the assumption that natural pedagogy was an independently selected adaptive cognitive system than considering it as a by-product of some other human-specific adaptation, such as language. By providing a qualitatively new type of social learning mechanism, natural pedagogy is not only the product but also one of the sources of the rich cultural heritage of our species.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. There is no doubt that Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives for the cognitive domain (Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, {\&} Krathwohl, 1956) has had a considerable impact on educational thought and practice all over the world. For example, the bibliographies by Cox and Unks (Note 1) and Cox and Wildeman (Note 2) list a large number of articles and reports describing applications of the taxonomy. The taxonomy has also been cited in dozens of papers concerned with educational research and development each year (ISI, 1970-1976). In this respect it has achieved one of Bloom's criteria for its success: The taxonomy must be accepted and used by workers in the field i is to be regarded as a useful and effective tool. (p. 24) In addition, the authors of the taxonomy made various claims about its properties that concern both educational and psychological issues. The educational issues are concerned with the categorization of educa-tional objectives "to facilitate communication" (p. 10). The psychological issues are the ordering of the categories to be "consistent with relevant and accepted psychological principles and theories" (p. 6). Over the years, these claims have stimulated a number of investigations to examine their validity, and as the taxonomy is now entering its twenty-second year, this review attempts to survey these investigations and to attempt an overall appraisal of the different findings. The complete validation of the properties of the taxonomy must go through two stages, the first concerned with the educational properties, the second with the psychological properties. A classification scheme may be validated with reference to the criteria of communicability, usefulness, and suggestiveness; while a},

abstract = {Historically, imitation has frequently been proposed as the central mechanism mediating the reproduction, spread, intergenerational transmission and stabilization of human cultural forms, population-specific behavioral traditions found in groups of non-human primates, or both we provide a critical reappraisal of the dominant role classically attributed to imitation in cultural reproduction. We argue that the properties of alternative social learning mechanisms (such as emulation or imitation) reflect the specific demand characteristics that different kinds of cultural products impose on their cultural transmission process to ensure their reproducibility. We distinguish between cultural forms whose functionally relevant aspects are cognitively 'transparent' versus 'opaque' for the observational learner and discuss the inherent relation between these properties on the one hand, and emulation versus imitation on the other. We argue how the emergence of different cultural environments with predominantly cognitively transparent versus opaque cultural forms may have led to the selection and specialization of suitable alternative social transmission mechanisms.},

abstract = {Abstract: Constructivist pedagogy draws on Piaget's developmental theory. Because Piaget depicted the emergence of formal reasoning skills in adolescence as part of the normal developmental pattern, many constructivists have assumed that intrinsic motivation is possible for all academic tasks. This paper argues that Piaget's concept of a formal operational stage has not been empirically verified and that the cognitive skills associated with that stage are in fact “biologically secondary abilities” (Geary and Bjorklund, 2000) culturally determined abilities that are difficult to acquire. Thus, it is unreasonable to expect that intrinsic motivation will suffice for most students for most higher level academic tasks. In addition, a case is made that educational psychology must incorporate the insights of evolutionary psychology.},
