abstract = {Background: Smad4 functions as a common mediator of transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling by forming complexes with the phosphorylated state of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins that act in specific signaling pathways to activate transcription. SMAD proteins comprise two domains, the MH1 and MH2 domain, separated by a linker region. The transcriptional activity and synergistic effect of Smad4 require a stretch of proline-rich sequence, the SMAD-activation domain (SAD), located N-terminal of the MH2 domain. To understand how the SAD contributes to Smad4 function, the crystal structure of a fragment including the SAD and MH2 domain (S4AF) was determined. Results: The structure of the S4AF trimer reveals novel features important for Smad4 function. A Smad4-specific sequence insertion within the MH2 domain interacts with the C-terminal tail to form a structural extension from the core. This extension (the TOWER) contains a solvent-accessible glutamine-rich helix. The SAD reinforces the TOWER and the structural core through interactions; two residues involved in these interactions are targets of tumorigenic mutation. The solvent-accessible proline residues of the SAD are located on the same face as the glutamine-rich helix of the TOWER, forming a potential transcription activation surface. A tandem sulfate-ion- binding site was identified within the subunit interface, which may interact with the phosphorylated C-terminal sequence of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins. Conclusions: The structure suggests that the SAD provides transcriptional capability by reinforcing the structural core and coordinating with the TOWER to present the proline-rich and glutamine-rich surfaces for interaction with transcription partners. The sulfate-ion-binding sites are potential 'receptors' for the phosphorylated sequence of pathway- restricted SMAD proteins in forming a heteromeric complex. The structure thus provides a new model that can be tested using biochemical and cellular approaches.},

abstract = {In the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) superfamily, activin A, TGF-$\beta$1, and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4) have various effects on hematopoiesis, including early mesodermo-hematogenesis. After these cytokines bind to their respective receptor, a regulatory Smad is phosphorylated and becomes associated with Smad4, the common Smad, and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. DLX1 is the product of a member of the distal-less homeobox gene family, which is known to have important roles in embryogenesis, particularly in cranio-facial development, and in GABAergic neurogenesis. DLX1 has been reported to be temporally and spatially coexpressed with BMP-4 during embryogenesis in selected contexts. We report here that, in addition to the previously reported regions/cells, DLX1 is expressed in hematopoietic cells in a lineage-dependent manner and that DLX1 interacts with Smad4 through its homeodomain. We show that it blocks multiple signals from TGF-$\beta$ superfamily cytokines such as activin A, TGF-$\beta$1, and BMP-4, including differentiation of a hematopoietic cell line by activin A. Taken together, these data suggest that DLX1 may function as a regulator of multiple signals from TGF-$\beta$ superfamily members in broad biological contexts during blood production.},

abstract = {KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an encyclopedia of genes and genomes. Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the KEGG database project. Molecularlevel functions are stored in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, where each KO is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks. KEGG is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information.},

abstract = {Pseudogenes are degraded fossil copies of genes. Here, we report a comparison of pseudogenes spanning three phyla, leveraging the completed annotations of the human, worm, and fly genomes, which we make available as an online resource. We find that pseudogenes are lineage specific, much more so than protein-coding genes, reflecting the different remodeling processes marking each organism's genome evolution. The majority of human pseudogenes are processed, resulting from a retrotranspositional burst at the dawn of the primate lineage. This burst can be seen in the largely uniform distribution of pseudogenes across the genome, their preservation in areas with low recombination rates, and their preponderance in highly expressed gene families. In contrast, worm and fly pseudogenes tell a story of numerous duplication events. In worm, these duplications have been preserved through selective sweeps, so we see a large number of pseudogenes associated with highly duplicated families such as chemoreceptors. However, in fly, the large effective population size and high deletion rate resulted in a depletion of the pseudogene complement. Despite large variations between these species, we also find notable similarities. Overall, we identify a broad spectrum of biochemical activity for pseudogenes, with the majority in each organism exhibiting varying degrees of partial activity. In particular, we identify a consistent amount of transcription ([{\~{}}]15{\%}) across all species, suggesting a uniform degradation process. Also, we see a uniform decay of pseudogene promoter activity relative to their coding counterparts and identify a number of pseudogenes with conserved upstream sequences and activity, hinting at potential regulatory roles.},

abstract = {Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 proteins are considered to be key mediators of transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling. However, the identities of the Smad partners mediating TGF-$\beta$ signaling are not fully understood. Here, we show that RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS), a member of the RNA-binding protein family, physically interacts with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 both in vitro and in vivo. The presence of TGF-$\beta$ increases the binding of RBPMS with these Smad proteins. Consistent with the binding results, overexpression of RBPMS enhances Smad-dependent transcriptional activity in a TGF-$\beta$-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of RBPMS decreases this activity. RBPMS interacts with TGF-$\beta$ receptor type I (T$\beta$R-I), increases phosphorylation of C-terminal SSXS regions in Smad2 and Smad3, and promotes the nuclear accumulation of the Smad proteins. Moreover, RBPMS fails to enhance the transcriptional activity of Smad2 and Smad3 that lack the C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Our data provide the first evidence for an RNA-binding protein playing a role in regulation of Smad-mediated transcriptional activity and suggest that RBPMS stimulates Smad-mediated transactivation possibly through enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 at the C-terminus and promotion of the nuclear accumulation of the Smad proteins. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Upon ligand binding, the receptors of the TGF$\beta$ family phosphorylate Smad proteins, which then move into the nucleus where they activate transcription. To carry out this function, the receptor-activated Smads 1 and 2 require association with the product of deleted in pancreatic carcinoma, locus 4 (DPC4), Smad4. We investigated the step at which Smad4 is required for transcriptional activation. Smad4 is not required for nuclear translocation of Smads 1 or 2, or for association of Smad2 with a DNA binding partner, the winged helix protein FAST-1. Receptor-activated Smad2 takes Smad4 into the nucleus where they form a complex with FAST-1 that requires these three components to activate transcription. Smad4 contributes two functions: Through its amino-terminal domain, Smad4 promotes binding of the Smad2/Smad4/FAST-1 complex to DNA; through its carboxy-terminal domain, Smad4 provides an activation function required for Smad1 or Smad2 to stimulate transcription. The dual function of Smad4 in transcriptional activation underscores its central role in TGF$\beta$ signaling.},

abstract = {Comparison of the gene expression repertoire in human hematopoietic progenitors and mature leukocytes led to identification of a transcript expressed in CD34+ cells and undetectable in differentiated cells. Sequencing of the cDNA (termed EHZF: early hemetopoietic zinc finger) revealed 30 zinc fingers with 96{\%} homology to mouse Evi3, a recently identified gene associated with the retroviral integration site in AKXD-27 B-cell lymphomas. EHZF and Evi3 share high homology with the transcription cofactor OAZ, implicated in the control of olfactory epithelium and B-lymphocyte differentiation and in the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signal transduction. Here we show that (1) EHZF expression is abundant in human CD34+ progenitors and declines rapidly during cytokine-driven differentiation; (2) significant mRNA levels are found in most acute myelogenous leukemias; (3) in response to BMPs EHZF complexes SMADs 1 and 4, binds to, and enhances the transcriptional activity of, a BMP2/4 responsive element; (4) EHZF inhibits the transcriptional activity of early B-cell factor (EBF), a transcription factor essential for specification of the B-cell lineage. Taken together, our data suggest that EHZF is likely to play a relevant role in the control of human hematopoiesis and might be implicated in the development of hematopoietic malignancies. {\textcopyright} 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.},

However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and -4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-$\beta$-like responses. When truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal TGF-$\beta$ response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was regulated by the TGF-$\beta$ receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD- 4 was phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-$\beta$ response and demonstrate a function for DPC-4/hMAD-4 as a turnout suppressor.},

abstract = {Smad4 plays a pivotal role in signal transduction of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ superfamily cytokines by mediating transcriptional activation of target genes. Hetero-oligomerization of Smad4 with the pathway-restricted SMAD proteins is essential for Smad4-mediated transcription. We provide evidence that SMAD hetero-oligomerization is directly required for the Smad4 C-terminal domain [Smad4(C)] to show its transcriptional transactivating activity; this requirement obtains even when Smad4(C) is recruited to promoters by heterologous DNA-binding domains and in the absence of the inhibitory Smad4 N-terminal domain. Defined mutations of GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion of Smad4(C) that disrupt SMAD hetero-oligomerization suppressed transcriptional activation. Importantly, we found that an orphan transcriptional activator MSG1, a nuclear protein that has strong transactivating activity but apparently lacks DNA-binding activity, functionally interacted with Smad4 and enhanced transcription mediated by GAL4 DNA-binding domain-Smad4(C) and full-length Smad4. Transcriptional enhancement by MSG1 depended on transforming growth factor $\beta$ signaling and was suppressed by Smad4(C) mutations disrupting SMAD hetero-oligomerization or by the presence of Smad4 N-terminal domain. Furthermore, Smad4(C) did not show any detectable transactivating activity in yeast when fused to heterologous DNA-binding domains. These results demonstrate additional roles of SMAD hetero-oligomerization in Smad4-mediated transcriptional activation. They also suggest that the transcriptional-activating activity observed in the presence of Smad4 in mammalian cells may be derived, at least in part, from endogenously expressed separate transcriptional activators, such as MSG1.},

To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of ∼90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.},

Recently, a gene for JPS was mapped to 18q21.1 and the candidate gene DPC4 (SMAD4) was shown to carry frameshift mutations in some JPS families. We have analysed eight JPS families for linkage to DPC4. Overall, there was no evidence for linkage to DPC4; linkage could be excluded in two of the eight pedigrees and was unlikely in two others. We then tested these eight families and a further 13 familial and sporadic JPS cases for germline mutations in DPC4. Just one germline DPC4 mutation was found (in a familial JPS patient from a pedigree unsuitable for linkage analysis). Like all three previously reported germline mutations, this variant occurred towards the C-terminus of the DPC4 protein. However, our patient's mutation is a missense change (R361C); somatic missense mutations in DPC4 have been reported previously in tumours.

abstract = {The TGF$\beta$ signaling pathway has pleiotropic functions regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility and invasion, extracellular matrix production, angiogenesis, and immune response. TGF$\beta$ signaling deregulation is frequent in tumors and has crucial roles in tumor initiation, development and metastasis. TGF$\beta$ signaling inhibition is an emerging strategy for cancer therapy. The role of the TGF$\beta$ pathway as a tumor-promoter or suppressor at the cancer cell level is still a matter of debate, due to its differential effects at the early and late stages of carcinogenesis. In contrast, at the microenvironment level, the TGF$\beta$ pathway contributes to generate a favorable microenvironment for tumor growth and metastasis throughout all the steps of carcinogenesis. Then, targeting the TGF$\beta$ pathway in cancer may be considered primarily as a microenvironment-targeted strategy. In this review, we focus on the TGF$\beta$ pathway as a target for cancer therapy. In the first part, we provide a comprehensive overview of the roles played by this pathway and its deregulation in cancer, at the cancer cell and microenvironment levels. We go on to describe the preclinical and clinical results of pharmacological strategies to target the TGF$\beta$ pathway, with a highlight on the effects on tumor microenvironment. We then explore the perspectives to optimize TGF$\beta$ inhibition therapy in different tumor settings.},

C-terminal phosphorylation of R-Smads leads to the recruitment of Smad4 and the formation of active signaling complexes. We investigated the mechanism of phosphorylation-induced Smad complex formation with an activating pseudo-phosphorylated Smad3. Pseudo-phosphorylated Smad3 has a greater propensity to homotrimerize, and recruits Smad4 to form a heterotrimer containing two Smad3 and one Smad4. The trimeric interaction is mediated through conserved interfaces to which tumorigenic mutations map. Furthermore, a conserved Arg residue within the L3 loop, located near the C-terminal phosphorylation sites of the neighboring subunit, is essential for trimerization. We propose that the phosphorylated C-terminal residues interact with the L3 loop of the neighboring subunlt to stabilize the trimer interaction.},

Twenty-five of 84 tumors had homozygous deletions at 18q21.1, a site that excludes DCC (a candidate suppressor gene for colorectal cancer) and includes DPC4, a gene similar in sequence to a Drosophila melanogaster gene (Mad) implicated in a transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$)-like signaling pathway. Potentially inactivating mutations in DPC4 were identified in six of 27 pancreatic carcinomas that did not have homozygous deletions at 18q21.1. These results identify DPC4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation may play a role in pancreatic and possibly other human cancers.},

abstract = {We have reported previously that PDK1 physically interacts with STRAP, a transforming growth factor-$\beta$(TGF-$\beta$) receptor-interacting protein, and enhances STRAP-induced inhibition of TGF-$\beta$ signaling. In this study we show that PDK1 coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins, including Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7, and that this association is mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1. The association between PDK1 and Smad proteins is increased by insulin treatment but decreased by TGF-$\beta$ treatment. Analysis of the interacting proteins shows that Smad proteins enhance PDK1 kinase activity by removing 14-3-3, a negative regulator of PDK1, from the PDK1-14-3-3 complex. Knockdown of endogenous Smad proteins, including Smad3 and Smad7, by transfection with small interfering RNA produced the opposite trend and decreased PDK1 activity, protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation, and Bad phosphorylation. Moreover, coexpression of Smad proteins and wild-type PDK1 inhibits TGF-$\beta$-induced transcription, as well as TGF-$\beta$-mediated biological functions, such as apoptosis and cell growth arrest. Inhibition was dose-dependent on PDK1, but no inhibition was observed in the presence of an inactive kinase-dead PDK1 mutant. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that wild-type PDK1 prevents translocation of Smad3 and Smad4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, as well as the redistribution of Smad7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-$\beta$. Taken together, our results suggest that PDK1 negatively regulates TGF-$\beta$-mediated signaling in a PDK1 kinase-dependent manner via a direct physical interaction with Smad proteins and that Smad proteins can act as potential positive regulators of PDK1. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The prognostic value of SMAD4 in pancreatic cancer has been evaluated in several studies. However, the conclusions remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between SMAD4 expression and the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant studies evaluating the relationship between SMAD4 expression and the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients until May 2015. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA 12.0, and pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of the association between SMAD4 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. RESULTS: The analysis included 1762 patients from 14 studies, with 1401 patients from 11 studies and 927 patients from 8 studies included in the univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Loss of SMAD4 expression was found to be significantly correlated with poor overall survival, with the combined HR (95{\%} CI) of 1.20 (1.03-1.40). After adjusting for potential confounders using the Cox regression model, the pooled HR (95{\%} CI) was 1.88 (1.31-2.70). In subgroup analysis, study region, number of patients, follow-up duration, and cutoff value were found to affect the significance of the association between loss of SMAD4 expression and poor prognosis. In addition, there was no evidence of publication bias, as suggested by Begg's and Egger's test. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of SMAD4 was associated with poor survival and was a negative prognostic indicator in patients with pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Germline BRCA2 mutations are the first known cause of inherited (familial) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This tumor is the third most frequent cancer in carriers of germline BRCA2 mutations, as it occurs in around 10{\%} of BRCA2 families. PDAC is known as one of the most highly lethal cancers, mainly because of its chemoresistance and frequently late diagnosis. Based on recent developments in molecular biology, a subgroup of BRCA2-associated PDAC has been created, allowing screening, early surgical treatment and personalized systemic treatment. BRCA2 germline mutation carriers who have ≥1 first-degree relative, or ≥2 blood relatives with PDAC, should undergo screening and regular follow-up based on magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound. The goal of screening is to detect early invasive PDAC and advanced precancerous lesions suitable for a stepwise surgical complete (R0) resection. Increasing evidence on the molecular role of the BRCA2 protein in the homologous recombination of DNA damages suggest that BRCA2-related PDAC are sensitive to agents causing DNA cross-linking damage, such as platinum salts, and treatments targeting rescue DNA repair pathways, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors that are currently under investigation.},

abstract = {Upon stimulation by the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated at their C termini and assemble into stable heteromeric complexes with Smad4. These complexes are the functional entities that translocate into the nucleus and regulate the expression of TGF-$\beta$ target genes. Here we report that the TGF-$\beta$-activated phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex utilizes an importin-independent mechanism for nuclear import and engages different nucleoporins for nuclear import compared with the monomeric Smad4. Within the heteromeric complex, phospho-Smad3 appears to dominate over Smad4 in the nuclear import process and guides the complex to its nuclear destination. We also demonstrate that the binding of phospho-Smad3 to Smad4 prevents Smad4 from interacting with the nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1. In this way, TGF-$\beta$ signaling suppresses nuclear export of Smad4 by chromosome region maintenance 1 and thereby targets Smad4 into the nucleus. Indeed tumorigenic mutations in Smad4 that affect its interaction with Smad2 or Smad3 impair nuclear accumulation of Smad4 in response to TGF-$\beta$. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Four variants were identified in SMADs 1, 4, and 9 among a cohort of 324 PAH cases, each not detected in a substantial control population. Of three amino acid substitutions identified, two demonstrated reduced signaling activity in vitro. A putative splice site mutation in SMAD4 resulted in moderate transcript loss due to compromised splicing efficiency.

In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework.

Here we show that, in the absence TGF-$\beta$ stimulation, Smads exist as monomers in vivo. Smad2 and Smad3 form homo-oligomers upon phosphorylation by the constitutively active TGF-$\beta$ type I receptor, and this oligomerization does not require Smad4. Major portions of Smad4, Smad6 and Smad7 are also present as monomers in vivo. Analysis using a cross-linking reagent suggested that the Smad2 oligomer induced by receptor activation is a trimer. Studies by gel chromatography demonstrated that the Smad2-Smad4 heteromer is not larger than the Smad2 homomer. Moreover, overexpression of Smad4 prevented Smad2 from forming a homo-oligomer. These findings suggest that Smad2 may form a homotrimer, or heterotrimers with Smad4, which are probably composed of two and one, or one and two molecules of Smad2 and Smad4, respectively, depending on the amount of each protein. Gel-mobility shift assay revealed that the Smad3 homomer and Smad3-Smad4 heteromer constitute DNA-binding complexes. Transition of the Smad proteins from monomers to oligomers is thus a critical event in the signal transduction of the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily members.},

Utilizing a differential display approach, we have identified two genes, Smad6 and Smad7, encoding members of the MAD-related family of molecules, selectively induced in cultured human vascular endothelial cells by steady laminar shear stress, a physiologic fluid mechanical stimulus. MAD-related proteins are a recently identified family of intracellular proteins that are thought to be essential components in the signaling pathways of the serine/threonine kinase receptors of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ superfamily. Smad6 and Smad7 possess unique structural features (compared with previously described MADs), and they can physically interact with each other, and, in the case of Smad6, with other known human MAD species, in endothelial cells. Transient expression of Smad6 or Smad7 in vascular endothelial cells inhibits the activation of a transfected reporter gene in response to both TGF-$\beta$ and fluid mechanical stimulation. Both Smad6 and Smad7 exhibit a selective pattern of expression in human vascular endothelium in vivo as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Thus, Smad6 and Smad7 constitute a novel class of MAD-related proteins, termed vascular MADS, that are induced by fluid mechanical forces and can modulate gene expression in response to both humoral and biomechanical stimulation in vascular endothelium.},

abstract = {The transcription factor Smad4 binds DNA in response to a TGF-beta ligand-initiated intracellular signaling cascade. SMAD4 is deleted or mutated during tumorigenesis in many human tumors. Some of these mutations occur in the N-terminal portion of the protein, the Mad homology 1 (MH1) region, which exhibits sequence-specific DNA-binding. We used alanine scanning mutagenesis and natural mutations to map the subregion of the MH1 domain necessary for that function. We created 20 individual mutations in the MH1 region of human Smad4 and assayed their effect on DNA-binding in vitro. Mutation of residues in the less conserved N- and C-terminal areas of the MH1 region had no effect on DNA-binding. However, mutations in the domain from L43 to R135 caused a dramatic reduction of the ability of Smad4 to bind DNA. Previous work demonstrated a $\beta$-hairpin protein motif within this region to be responsible for DNA-binding, but suggested that the tumorigenic mutations occurring outside this motif may target a separate function of the MH1 domain. Our results demonstrate that the MH1 domain as a whole is very sensitive to changes in overall structure, and that tumorigenic mutations within the region of L43-R135 indeed would target DNA-binding.},

abstract = {Smad proteins transduce signals for transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$)-related factors. Smad proteins activated by receptors for TGF-$\beta$ form complexes with Smad4. These complexes are translocated into the nucleus and regulate ligand induced gene transcription. 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive gene promoter elements (TREs) are involved in the transcriptional responses of several genes to TGF-$\beta$ (refs 5-8). AP-1 transcription factors, composed of c-Jun and c-Fos, bind to and direct transcription from TREs, which are therefore known as AP1-binding sites. Here we show that Smad3 interacts directly with the TRE and that Smad3 and Smad4 can activate TGF-$\beta$-inducible transcription from the TRE in the absence of c- Jun and c-Fos Smad3 and Smad4 also act together with c-Jun and c-Fos to activate transcription in response to TGF-$\beta$, through a TGF-$\beta$-inducible association of c-Jun with Smad3 and an interaction of Smad3 and c-Fos. These interactions complement interactions between c-Jun and c-Fos, and between Smad3 and Smad4. This mechanism of transcriptional activation by TGF-$\beta$, through functional and physical interactions between Smad3-Smad4 and c-Jun- c-Fos, shows that Smad signalling and MAPK/JNK signalling converge at AP1- binding promoter sites.},

abstract = {Pokemon, an important proto-oncoprotein, is a transcriptional repressor that belongs to the POK (. POZ and Kr{\"{u}}ppel) family. Smad4, a key component of TGF-$\beta$ pathway, plays an essential role in TGF-$\beta$-induced transcriptional responses. In this study, we show that Pokemon can interact directly with Smad4 both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Pokemon decreases TGF-$\beta$-induced transcriptional activities, whereas knockdown of Pokemon increases these activities. Interestingly, Pokemon does not affect activation of Smad2/3, formation of Smads complex, or DNA binding activity of Smad4. TGF-$\beta$1 treatment increases the interaction between Pokemon and Smad4, and also enhances the recruitment of Pokemon to Smad4-DNA complex. In addition, we also find that Pokemon recruits HDAC1 to Smad4 complex but decreases the interaction between Smad4 and p300/CBP. Taken together, all these data suggest that Pokemon is a new partner of Smad4 and plays a negative role in TGF-$\beta$ pathway.},

abstract = {LKB1 is a serine/threonine kinase which is inactivated by mutation in the Peutz-Jeghers polyposis and cancer predisposition syndrome (PJS). We have identified a novel leucine-rich repeat containing protein, LIP1, that interacts with LKB1. The LIP1 gene consists of 25 exons, maps to human chromosome 2q36 and encodes a protein of 121 kDa. LIP1 appears to be a cytoplasmically located protein whereas we and others have shown previously that LKB1 is predominantly nuclear, with only a small proportion of cells showing strong cytoplasmic expression. However, when LKB1 and LIP1 are co-expressed, the proportion of cytoplasmic LKB1 dramatically increases, suggesting that LIP1 may regulate LKB1 function by controlling its subcellular localization. Ectopic expression of both LKB1 and LIP1 in Xenopus embryos induces a secondary body axis, providing further evidence for a functional link between the two proteins. This phenotype resembles the effects of ectopic expression of TGF$\beta$ super-family members and their downstream effectors. A possible role for LIP1 and LKB1 in TGF$\beta$ signalling is supported by the observation that LIP1 interacts with the TGF$\beta$-regulated transcription factor SMAD4, forming a LKB1-LIP1-SMAD4 ternary complex. SMAD4 mutations give rise to juvenile polyposis syndrome, which is clinically similar to PJS. Our data suggest an unsuspected mechanistic link between these two syndromes.},

abstract = {Background: Juvenile polyposis (JP) is an inherited condition predisposing to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) polyps and colorectal cancer. Two genes are known to predisose to JP, SMAD4 and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A (BMPR1A). The object of this study was to determine the differences in phenotype of patients with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations (MUT+) compared with those without (MUT-). Methods: DNA was extracted from 54 JP probands and used for polymerase chain reaction of all exons of SMAD4 and BMPR1A. Products were then sequenced and analyzed for mutations. Medical record data were used to create a JP database, and statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact and unpaired t-tests. Results: Nine of 54 patients had germline SMAD4 mutations, 13 had BMPR1A mutations, and 32 had neither. There were no significant differences between SMAD4 + and BMPR1A + cases in terms of clinical factors examined, except for a family history of UGI involvement (P {\textless} .01). There was a higher prevalence of familial cases in MUT+ patients (P = 09), {\textgreater} 10 lower gastrointestinal polyps (P = .06), and frequency of family history of gastrointestinal cancer compared with MUT-patients (P = .01). Conclusions: Patients with germline SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations have a more prominent JP phenotype than those without, and SMAD4 mutations predispose to UGI polyposis.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) is a multifunctional cytokine signaling to the nucleus through cell surface transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases and cytoplasmic effectors, including Smad proteins. We describe a novel modulator of this pathway, TLP (TRAP-1-like protein), which is 25{\%} identical to the previously described Smad4 chaperone, TRAP-1, and shows identical expression patterns in human tissues. Endogenous TLP associates with both active and kinase-deficient TGF-$\beta$ and activin type II receptors, but interacts with the common-mediator Smad4 only in the presence of TGF-$\beta$/activin signaling. Overexpression of TLP represses the ability of TGF-$\beta$ to induce transcription from SBE-Luc, a Smad3/4-specific reporter, while it potentiates transcription from ARE-Luc, a Smad2/4-specific reporter. Consistent with this, TLP inhibits the formation of Smad3/4 complexes in the absence of effects on phosphorylation of Smad3, while it affects neither Smad2 phosphorylation nor hetero-oligomerization. We propose that TLP might regulate the balance of Smad2 and Smad3 signaling by localizing Smad4 intracellularly, thus contributing to cellular specificity of TGF-$\beta$ transcriptional responses in both normal and pathophysiology.},

abstract = {In response to transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), Smad4 forms complexes with activated Smad2 and Smad3, which accumulate in the nucleus, where they both positively and negatively regulate TGF-$\beta$ target genes. Mutation or deletion of Smad4 is found in about 50{\%} of pancreatic tumors and in about 15{\%} of colorectal tumors. As Smad4 is a central component of the TGF-$\beta$/Smad pathway, we have determined whether Smad4 is absolutely required for all TGF-$\beta$ responses, to evaluate the effect of its loss during human tumor development. We have generated cell lines from the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT or the pancreatic tumor cell line Colo-357, which stably express a tetracyline-inducible small interfering RNA targeted against Smad4. In response to tetracycline, Smad4 expression is effectively silenced. Large-scale microarray analysis identifies two populations of TGF-$\beta$ target genes that are distinguished by their dependency on Smad4. Some genes absolutely require Smad4 for their regulation, while others do not. Functional analysis also indicates a differential Smad4 requirement for TGF-$\beta$-induced functions; TGF-$\beta$-induced cell cycle arrest and migration, but not epithelial-mesenchymal transition, are abolished after silencing of Smad4. Altogether our results suggest that loss of Smad4 might promote TGF-$\beta$-mediated tumorigenesis by abolishing tumor-suppressive functions of TGF-$\beta$ while maintaining some tumor-promoting TGF-$\beta$ responses.},

OAZ contains a BMP signaling module formed by two clusters of fingers that bind Smads and the Xvent-2 BMP response element, respectively. Previously implicated as a transcriptional partner of OIf-1/EBF in olfactory epithelium and lymphocyte development in the rat, OAZ fulfills this role through clusters of fingers that are separate from the BMP signaling module. The mutually exclusive use of OAZ by the BMP-Smad and Olf pathways illustrates the dual role of a multi-zinc finger protein in signal transduction during development.},

Here, by performing exome sequencing of a single affected individual and coupling the results to a hypothesis-driven filtering strategy, we establish that heterozygous mutations in SMAD4, which encodes for a transducer mediating transforming growth factor $\beta$ and bone morphogenetic protein signaling branches, underlie this rare Mendelian trait. Two recurrent de novo SMAD4 mutations were identified in eight unrelated subjects. Both mutations were missense changes altering Ile500 within the evolutionary conserved MAD homology 2 domain, a well known mutational hot spot in malignancies. Structural analyses suggest that the substituted residues are likely to perturb the binding properties of the mutant protein to signaling partners. Although SMAD4 has been established as a tumor suppressor gene somatically mutated in pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and skin cancers, and germline loss-of-function lesions and deletions of this gene have been documented to cause disorders that predispose individuals to gastrointestinal cancer and vascular dysplasias, the present report identifies a previously unrecognized class of mutations in the gene with profound impact on development and growth. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

PDAC frequently presents at an advanced stage with extensive metastasis, which portends a poor prognosis. The known risk factors associated with PDAC include advanced age, smoking, long-standing chronic pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes. Its association with genomic and somatic mutations is the most important factor for its aggressiveness. The most common gene mutations associated with PDAC include KRas2, p16, TP53, and Smad4. Among these, Smad4 mutation is relatively specific and its inactivation is found in more than 50{\%} of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Smad4 is a member of the Smad family of signal transducers and acts as a central mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$) signaling pathways. The TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway promotes many physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, fibrosis, and scar formation. It also plays a major role in the development of tumors through induction of angiogenesis and immune suppression. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanism of TGF-$\beta$/Smad4 signaling in the pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its clinical implication, particularly potential as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target.},

Small Ubiquitin-like Modifiers (SUMOs) are known to counteract replication stress, nevertheless, only a small number of relevant SUMO target proteins are known. To address this, we have purified and identified SUMO-2 target proteins regulated by replication stress in human cells. The developed methodology enabled single step purification of His10-SUMO-2 conjugates under denaturing conditions with high yield and high purity. Following statistical analysis on five biological replicates, a total of 566 SUMO-2 targets were identified. After 2 h of hydroxyurea treatment, 10 proteins were up-regulated for SUMOylation and two proteins were down-regulated for SUMOylation, whereas after 24 h, 35 proteins were up-regulated for SUMOylation, and 13 proteins were downregulated for SUMOylation. A site-specific approach was used to map over 1000 SUMO-2 acceptor lysines in target proteins. The methodology is generic and is widely applicable in the ubiquitin field. A large subset of these identified proteins function in one network that consists of interacting replication factors, transcriptional regulators, DNA damage response factors including MDC1, ATR-interacting protein ATRIP, the Bloom syndrome protein and the BLM-binding partner RMI1, the crossover junction endonuclease EME1, BRCA1, and CHAF1A. Furthermore, centromeric proteins and signal transducers were dynamically regulated by SUMOylation upon replication stress. Our results uncover a comprehensive network of SUMO target proteins dealing with replication damage and provide a framework for detailed understanding of the role of SUMOylation to counteract replication stress. Ultimately, our study reveals how a post-translational modification is able to orchestrate a large variety of different proteins to integrate different nuclear processes with the aim of dealing with the induced DNA damage.},

The former, an inherited gastrointestinal malignancy predisposition, is caused by mutations in MADH4 (encoding SMAD4) or BMPR1A, and the latter is a vascular malformation disorder caused by mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (ALK1). All four genes encode proteins involved in the transforming-growth- factor-$\beta$ signalling pathway. Although there are reports of patients and families with phenotypes of both disorders combined, the genetic aetiology of this association is unknown. Methods Blood samples were collected from seven unrelated families segregating both phenotypes. DNA from the proband of each family was sequenced for the ACVRL1, ENG, and MADH4 genes. Mutations were examined for familial cosegregation with phenotype and presence or absence in population controls. Findings No patient had mutations in the ENG or ACVRL1 genes; all had MADH4 mutations. Three cases of de-novo MADH4 mutations were found. In one, the mutation was passed on to a similarly affected child. Each mutation cosegregated with the syndromic phenotype in other affected family members. Interpretation Mutations in MADH4 can cause a syndrome consisting of both juvenile polyposis and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia phenotypes. Since patients with these disorders are generally ascertained through distinct medical specialties, genetic testing is recommended for patients presenting with either phenotype to identify those at risk of this syndrome. Patients with juvenile polyposis who have an MADH4 mutation should be screened for the vascular lesions associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, especially occult arteriovenous malformations in visceral organs that may otherwise present suddenly with serious medical consequences.},

abstract = {Intra-host sequence data from RNA viruses have revealed the ubiquity of defective viruses in natural viral populations, sometimes at surprisingly high frequency. Although defective viruses have long been known to laboratory virologists, their relevance in clinical and epidemiological settings has not been established. The discovery of long-term transmission of a defective lineage of dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) in Myanmar, first seen in 2001, raised important questions about the emergence of transmissible defective viruses and their role in viral epidemiology. By combining phylogenetic analyses and dynamical modeling, we investigate how evolutionary and ecological processes at the intra-host and inter-host scales shaped the emergence and spread of the defective DENV-1 lineage. We show that this lineage of defective viruses emerged between June 1998 and February 2001, and that the defective virus was transmitted primarily through co-transmission with the functional virus to uninfected individuals. We provide evidence that, surprisingly, this co-transmission route has a higher transmission potential than transmission of functional dengue viruses alone. Consequently, we predict that the defective lineage should increase overall incidence of dengue infection, which could account for the historically high dengue incidence reported in Myanmar in 2001-2002. Our results show the unappreciated potential for defective viruses to impact the epidemiology of human pathogens, possibly by modifying the virulence-transmissibility trade-off, or to emerge as circulating infections in their own right. They also demonstrate that interactions between viral variants, such as complementation, can open new pathways to viral emergence.},

abstract = {Tumor suppressor Smad4 is the common signaling effector in the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) superfamily. Phosphorylated regulatory Smads (R-Smads) interact with Smad4, and the complex translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. Proper TGF-$\beta$ signaling requires precise control of Smad functions. Smurfs have been shown to mediate the degradation of R-Smads but not the common-partner Smad4. We report a novel mechanism of Smad4 degradation. Jab1 interacts directly with Smad4 and induces its ubiquitylation for degradation. Jab1 was initially identified as a co-activator of c-Jun, and it also induces degradation of cell cycle inhibitor p27 and tumor suppressor p53. Ectopic expression of Jab1 decreased endogenous Smad4 steady-state levels. The 26S proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132 reduced the degradation rate of Smad4 protein. Examination of the effects of JAB1-induced Smad4 degradation indicates that Jab1 inhibited TGF-$\beta$-induced gene transcription. Our data suggest that Jab1 antagonizes TGF-$\beta$ function by inducing degradation of Smad4 through a distinct degradation pathway.},

To identify candidate tumor suppressor genes on 18q, a panel of pancreatic carcinomas were analyzed for convergent sites of homozygous deletion. Twenty-five of 84 tumors had homozygous deletions at 18q21.1, a site that excludes DCC (a candidate suppressor gene for colorectal cancer) and includes DPC4, a gene similar in sequence to a Drosophila melanogaster gene (Mad) implicated in a transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$)-like signaling pathway. Potentially inactivating mutations in DPC4 were identified in six of 27 pancreatic carcinomas that did not have homozygous deletions at 18q21.1. These results identify DPC4 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation may play a role in pancreatic and possibly other human cancers.},

Here we used an augmented K0-SUMO proteomics strategy to identify 40,765 SUMO acceptor sites and quantify their fractional contribution for 6,747 human proteins. Structural-predictive analyses revealed that lysines residing in disordered regions are preferentially targeted by SUMO, in notable contrast to other widespread lysine modifications. In our data set, we identified 807 SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by phosphorylation, along with dozens of SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by ubiquitylation, acetylation and methylation. Notably, 9{\%} of the identified SUMOylome occurred proximal to phosphorylation, and numerous SUMOylation sites were found to be fully dependent on prior phosphorylation events. SUMO-proximal phosphorylation occurred primarily in a proline-directed manner, and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases dynamically affected co-modification. Collectively, we present a comprehensive analysis of the SUMOylated proteome, uncovering the structural preferences for SUMO and providing system-wide evidence for a remarkable degree of cross-talk between SUMOylation and other major PTMs.},

abstract = {To identify novel genes that play critical roles in mediating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Smad1 as bait. A novel mouse Kr{\"{u}}ppel-type zinc finger protein, mZnf8, was isolated. Interactions between mZnf8 and Smad proteins were further analyzed with various in vitro and in vivo approaches, including mammalian two-hybrid, in vitro glutathione S -transferase pulldown, and copurification assays. Results from functional analysis indicate that mZnf8 is a nuclear transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of mZnf8 represses activity of BMP and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$) reporters. Silencing the expression of endogenous mZnf8 with an RNA interference approach caused a significant increase in the expression of one BMP reporter. These results suggest that mZnf8 negatively regulates the TGF-$\beta$/BMP signaling pathway in vivo. Transcription of mZnf8 is ubiquitous in mouse embryos, but high levels are specifically observed in adult mouse testes, with the same cell- and stage-specific transcription pattern as Smad1 . Our data support the hypothesis that mZnf8 plays critical roles in mediating BMP signaling during spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {CREB3L1 (cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 1), a transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor and activated through Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), is essential for collagen production by osteoblasts during bone development. Here, we show that TGF-$\beta$ (transforming growth factor-$\beta$), a cytokine known to stimulate production of collagen during wound healing and fibrotic diseases, induces proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 in human A549 cells. This activation results from inhibition of expression of TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L6 family member 20), which normally inhibits RIP of CREB3L1. Cleavage of CREB3L1 releases its NH2-terminal domain from membranes, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it binds to Smad4 to activate transcription of genes encoding proteins required for assembly of collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Our findings raise the possibility that inhibition of RIP of CREB3L1 could prevent excess deposition of collagen in certain fibrotic diseases.},

Technological limitations have so far prevented a global analysis of lysine acetylation's cellular roles. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 proteins and quantified acetylation changes in response to the deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and MS-275. Lysine acetylation preferentially targets large macromolecular complexes involved in diverse cellular processes, such as chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, splicing, nuclear transport, and actin nucleation. Acetylation impaired phosphorylation-dependent interactions of 14-3-3 and regulated the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Our data demonstrate that the regulatory scope of lysine acetylation is broad and comparable with that of other major posttranslational modifications.},

Finally we have developed a machine learning method which gives a cross-validated accuracy of 0.846, considerably out-performing well known methods including SIFT and PolyPhen2 which give accuracies between 0.690 and 0.785. We have updated SAAPdb and improved its analyses, but with the increasing rate with which mutation data are generated, we have created a new analysis pipeline and web interface.

abstract = {Smad family members are newly identified essential intracellular signalling components of the transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) superfamily. Smad2 and Smad3 are structurally highly similar and mediate TGF-$\beta$ signals. Smad4 is distantly related to Smads 2 and 3, and forms a heteromeric complex with Smad2 after TGF-$\beta$ or activin stimulation. Here we show that Smad2 and Smad3 interacted with the kinase-deficient TGF-$\beta$ type I receptor (T$\beta$R)-I after it was phosphorylated by T$\beta$R-II kinase. TGF-$\beta$1 induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells. Smad4 was found to be constitutively phosphorylated in Mv1Lu cells, the phosphorylation level remaining unchanged upon TGF-$\beta$1 stimulation. Similar results were obtained using HSC4 cells, which are also growth-inhibited by TGF-$\beta$. Smads 2 and 3 interacted with Smad4 after T$\beta$R activation in transfected COS cells. In addition, we observed T$\beta$R-activation-dependent interaction between Smad2 and Smad3. Smads 2, 3 and 4 accumulated in the nucleus upon TGF-$\beta$1 treatment in Mv1Lu cells, and showed a synergistic effect in a transcriptional reporter assay using the TGF-$\beta$-inducible plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter. Dominant-negative Smad3 inhibited the transcriptional synergistic response by Smad2 and Smad4. These data suggest that TGF-$\beta$ induces heteromeric complexes of Smads 2, 3 and 4, and their concomitant translocation to the nucleus, which is required for efficient TGF-$\beta$ signal transduction.},

By means of siRNA screen we identified FAM (USP9x), a deubiquitinase acting as essential and evolutionarily conserved component in TGF$\beta$ and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Smad4 is monoubiquitinated in lysine 519 in vivo, a modification that inhibits Smad4 by impeding association with phospho-Smad2. FAM reverts this negative modification, re-empowering Smad4 function. FAM opposes the activity of Ectodermin/Tif1$\gamma$ (Ecto), a nuclear factor for which we now clarify a prominent role as Smad4 monoubiquitin ligase. Our study points to Smad4 monoubiquitination and deubiquitination as a way for cells to set their TGF$\beta$ responsiveness: loss of FAM disables Smad4-dependent responses in several model systems, with Ecto being epistatic to FAM.

Signals are initiated upon binding of TGF$\beta$ superfamily members to cell-surface serine/threonine kinase receptors and are then propagated by the intracellular mediators known as Smads. Activation of Smads results in their translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they activate or repress transcription together with transcription factors so as to regulate target gene expression. Most Smads consist of two conserved domains, Mad homology (MH) domains 1 and 2, which are separated by a non-conserved linker region. These domains lack enzymatic activity and, instead, Smads mediate their effects through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Targeted disruption of Smad genes in mice has revealed their importance in embryonic development, and a tumor-suppressor role for Smads in human cancers has been described. Smads therefore play an essential role in mediating TGF$\beta$-superfamily signals in development and disease.},

abstract = {This chapter contends that language could have originated as a device for bonding in large social groups. Grooming is the mechanism of choice among primates to bond social groups, but human social groups tend to be too large for grooming to bond them effectively. Based on this account, language emerged as a form of grooming-at-a-distance, which is reflected in the large amount of time typically spent verbally ‘servicing' social relationships. The use of primate-like vocalisations in chorusing — a kind of communal singing — was a key intermediate step in the evolution of language. Once such cooperative use of vocalisations was in place, grammar could then emerge through processes of natural selection. This standard Darwinian perspective finds support from recent mathematical game theory modelling of language evolution. In addition, language has the extraordinary capacity to diversify into new dialects and distinct languages, suggesting that this property of language may have evolved to make it easier for members of social groups to identify each other, Thus, the social origin of language can explain both the origin and subsequent diversification of language.},

abstract = {The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-$\beta$ induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-$\beta$-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-$\beta$-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-$\beta$ signaling by interacting with NCoR and Smad4.},

Smad4/DPC4, and the related tumour suppressor Smad2, belong to the SMAD family of proteins that mediate signalling by the TGF-beta/activin/BMP-2/4 cytokine superfamily from receptor Ser/Thr protein kinases at the cell surface to the nucleus. SMAD proteins, which are phosphorylated by the activated receptor, propagate the signal, in part, through homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions. Smad4/DPC4 plays a central role as it is the shared hetero-oligomerization partner of the other SMADs. The conserved carboxy-terminal domains of SMADs are sufficient for inducing most of the ligand-specific effects, and are the primary targets of tumorigenic inactivation. We now describe the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the Smad4/DPC4 tumour suppressor, determined at 2.5 A resolution. The structure reveals that the Smad4/DPC4 CTD forms a crystallographic trimer through a conserved protein-protein interface, to which the majority of the tumour-derived missense mutations map. These mutations disrupt homo-oligomerization in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the trimeric assembly of the Smad4/DPC4 CTD is critical for signalling and is disrupted by tumorigenic mutations.},

abstract = {Transforming growth fazctor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) family members regulate many developmental and pathological events through Smad transcriptional modulators. How nuclear accumulation of Smad is coupled to the transcriptional machinery is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that in response to TGF$\beta$ stimulation the transcriptional regulator TAZ binds heteromeric Smad2/3-4 complexes and is recruited to TGF$\beta$ response elements. In human embryonic stem cells TAZ is required to maintain self-renewal markers and loss of TAZ leads to inhibition of TGF$\beta$ signalling and differentiation into a neuroectoderm lineage. In the absence of TAZ, Smad2/3-4 complexes fail to accumulate in the nucleus and activate transcription. Furthermore, TAZ, which itself engages in shuttling, dominantly controls Smad nucleocytoplasmic localization and can be retained in the nucleus by transcriptional co-factors such as ARC105, a component of the Mediator complex. TAZ thus defines a hierarchical system regulating Smad nuclear accumulation and coupling to the transcriptional machinery.},
