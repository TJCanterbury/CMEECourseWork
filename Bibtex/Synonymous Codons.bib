abstract = {Natural selection at one site shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of “linked selection” on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated.},

@article{Kotlar2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question of whether synonymous codon choice is affected by cellular tRNA abundance has been positively answered in many organisms. In some recent works, concerning the human genome, this relation has been studied, but no conclusive answers have been found. In the human genome, the variation in base composition and the absence of cellular tRNA count data makes the study of the question more complicated. In this work we study the relation between codon choice and tRNA abundance in the human genome by correcting relative codon usage for background base composition and using a measure based on tRNA-gene copy numbers as a rough estimate of tRNA abundance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We term major codons to be those codons with a relatively large tRNA-gene copy number for their corresponding amino acid. We use two measures of expression: breadth of expression (the number of tissues in which a gene was expressed) and maximum expression level among tissues (the highest value of expression of a gene among tissues). We show that for half the amino acids in the study (8 of 16) the relative major codon usage rises with breadth of expression. We show that these amino acids are significantly more frequent, are smaller and simpler, and are more ancient than the rest of the amino acids. Similar, although weaker, results were obtained for maximum expression level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: There is evidence that codon bias in the human genome is related to selection, although the selection forces acting on codon bias may not be straightforward and may be different for different amino acids. We suggest that, in the first group of amino acids, selection acts to enhance translation efficiency in highly expressed genes by preferring major codons, and acts to reduce translation rate in lowly expressed genes by preferring non-major ones. In the second group of amino acids other selection forces, such as reducing misincorporation rate of expensive amino acids, in terms of their size/complexity, may be in action. The fact that codon usage is more strongly related to breadth of expression than to maximum expression level supports the notion, presented in a recent study, that codon choice may be related to the tRNA abundance in the tissue in which a gene is expressed.},

abstract = {The housekeeping (ubiquitously expressed) genes in the mammal genome were shown here to be on average slightly GC-richer than tissue-specific genes. Both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes occupy similar ranges of GC content, but the former tend to concentrate in the upper part of the range. In the human genome, tissue-specific genes show two maxima, GC-poor and GC-rich. The strictly tissue-specific human genes tend to concentrate in the GC-poor region; their distribution is left-skewed and thus reciprocal to the distribution of housekeeping genes. The intermediately tissue-specific genes show an intermediate GC content and the right-skewed distribution. Both in the human and mouse, genes specific for some tissues (e.g., parts of the central nervous system) have a higher average GC content than housekeeping genes. Since they are not transcribed in the germ line (in contrast to housekeeping genes), and therefore have a lower probability of inheritable gene conversion, this finding contradicts the biased gene conversion (BGC) explanation for elevated GC content in the heavy isochores of mammal genome. Genes specific for germ-line tissues (ovary, testes) show a low average GC content, which is also in contradiction to the BGC explanation. Both for the total data set and for the most part tissues taken separately, a weak positive correlation was found between gene GC content and expression level. The fraction of ubiquitously expressed genes is nearly 1.5-fold higher in the mouse than in the human. This suggests that mouse tissues are comparatively less differentiated (on the molecular level), which can be related to a less pronounced isochoric structure of the mouse genome. In each separate tissue (in both species), tissue-specific genes do not form a clear-cut frequency peak (in contrast to housekeeping genes), but constitute a continuum with a gradually increasing degree of tissue-specificity, which probably reflects the path of cell differentiation and/or an independent use of the same protein in several unrelated tissues.},

abstract = {Do data from the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project render the notion of junk DNA obsolete? Here, I review older arguments for junk grounded in the C-value paradox and propose a thought experiment to challenge ENCODE's ontology. Specifically, what would we expect for the number of functional elements (as ENCODE defines them) in genomes much larger than our own genome? If the number were to stay more or less constant, it would seem sensible to consider the rest of the DNA of larger genomes to be junk or, at least, assign it a different sort of role (structural rather than informational). If, however, the number of functional elements were to rise significantly with C-value then, (i) organisms with genomes larger than our genome are more complex phenotypically than we are, (ii) ENCODE's definition of functional element identifies many sites that would not be considered functional or phenotype-determining by standard uses in biology, or (iii) the same phenotypic functions are often determined in a more diffuse fashion in larger-genomed organisms. Good cases can be made for propositions ii and iii. A larger theoretical framework, embracing informational and structural roles for DNA, neutral as well as adaptive causes of complexity, and selection as a multilevel phenomenon, is needed.},

@article{Bulmer1991a,
abstract = {It is argued that the bias in synonymous codon usage observed in unicellular organisms is due to a balance between the forces of selection and mutation in a finite population, with greater bias in highly expressed genes reflecting stronger selection for efficiency of translation. A population genetic model is developed taking into account population size and selective differences between synonymous codons. A biochemical model is then developed to predict the magnitude of selective differences between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of translation. A model for the effect of speed of translation on fitness is considered in detail, a similar model for accuracy more briefly. The model is successful in predicting a difference in the degree of bias at the beginning than in the rest of the gene under some circumstances, as observed in Escherichia coli, but grossly overestimates the amount of bias expected. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

abstract = {Synonymous codon usage bias is an inevitable phenomenon in organismic taxa across the three domains of life. Though the frequency of codon usage is not equal across species and within genome in the same species, the phenomenon is non random and is tissue-specific. Several factors such as GC content, nucleotide distribution, protein hydropathy, protein secondary structure, and translational selection are reported to contribute to codon usage preference. The synonymous codon usage patterns can be helpful in revealing the expression pattern of genes as well as the evolutionary relationship between the sequences. In this study, synonymous codon usage bias patterns were determined for the evolutionarily close proteins of albumin superfamily, namely, albumin, $\alpha$-fetoprotein, afamin, and vitamin D-binding protein. Our study demonstrated that the genes of the four albumin superfamily members have low GC content and high values of effective number of codons (ENC) suggesting high expressivity of these genes and less bias in codon usage preferences. This study also provided evidence that the albumin superfamily members are not subjected to mutational selection pressure.},

@article{Hershberg2008,
abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, synonymous codons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as codon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major cause for selection on codon bias is that certain preferred codons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes maybe even contradictory selective forces appear to affect codon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways in which natural selection participates in the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise several open questions: (i) Is natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred codons is weak only when codon bias approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong on genes with codon bias levels that are much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major codons? (iii) How do shifts in codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection on codon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on how they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

abstract = {Forty different single-factor criteria and multi-factor hypotheses about chronological order of appearance of amino acids in the early evolution are summarized in consensus ranking. All available knowledge and thoughts about origin and evolution of the genetic code are thus combined in a single list where the amino acids are ranked chronologically. Due to consensus nature of the chronology it has several important properties not visible in individual rankings by any of the initial criteria. Nine amino acids of the Miller's imitation of primordial environment are all ranked as topmost (G, A, V, D, E, P, S, L, T). This result does not change even after several criteria related to Miller's data are excluded from calculations. The consensus order of appearance of the 20 amino acids on the evolutionary scene also reveals a unique and strikingly simple chronological organization of 64 codons, that could not be figured out from individual criteria: New codons appear in descending order of their thermostability, as complementary pairs, with the complements recruited sequentially from the codon repertoires of the earlier or simultaneously appearing amino acids. These three rules (Thermostability, Complementarity and Processivity) hold strictly as well as leading position of the earliest amino acids according to Miller. The consensus chronology of amino acids, G/A, V/D, P, S, E/L, T, R, N, K, Q, I, C, H, F, M, Y, W, and the derived temporal order for codons may serve, thus, as a justified working model of choice for further studies on the origin and evolution of the genetic code. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@incollection{Sonneborn2014,
abstract = {Part I of this paper deals with the amount of degeneracy in the genetic code or, looked at in reverse, the amount of nonsense. Section A considers the experimental evidence and suggests (a) that technical difficulties have prevented assigning meaning to the still unassigned triplets and (b) that the validity of the earlier evidences for nonsense triplets may be questioned in the light of recent discoveries. Complete degeneracy of the code and total absence of nonsense have not yet been excluded. Section B comes to the conclusion, on the basis of general evolutionary considerations, that natural selection would be expected to establish and preserve a completely degenerate code. Section C points out that different nondegenerate codes differ greatly in the builtin frequency of nonsense mutations by single base substitutions. Part II deals with the nature of degeneracy in the existing code. The high frequency of shared doublets between “synonyms” (i.e., codons for the same amino acid) suggests that they are “connected,” that is, interconvertible by altering one base only. Among the sets of synonyms thus far reported, some must be completely connected, and, in the absence of knowledge of the order of the bases, the synonyms of each set could be ordered so as to be completely connected. Current knowledge leads to the expectation of either complete connectedness or a high degree of connectedness among synonyms. Part III explores the consequences of complete connectedness between synonyms; the consequences would be modified only quantitatively, not qualitatively, if connectedness is less than complete. Section A discusses “silent” mutations, i.e., single-base changes that yield a synonym. These must occur in the code as now known. Their frequency (if equal probability of all base substitutions is assumed) depends on the number of synonyms in a set, on the way in which the synonyms are connected, and on whether the various synonyms are used equally or unequally. By selecting one synonym of a set for almost exclusive usage, the minimal percentage of silent mutations stays constant at 11.1{\%} in sets of two or more synonyms, but the maximum increases steadily with set size up to 100{\%} in sets of ten or more. If the synonyms of a set are equally used, the pattern of connection that yields the highest frequency of silent mutations gives peaks for sets of four, seven, and ten synonyms. It would not be surprising if 20{\%} or more of all single-base mutations were silent unless the frequency of trans versions is greatly restricted. Comparable analyses can be made of a quadruplet code. The frequency of mutations to synonyms is not enough to account fully for modulatory mutations, but it is enough to constitute a potential source of error in certain amino acid replacement studies. Section B points out that the degeneracy of the existing code implies as an evolutionary consequence a molecular orthogenesis, that is, marked built-in differences among the synonyms of a set in their possible amino acid replacements by single-base mutations. Section C shows the surprising fact that crossing over between synonyms must in certain cases yield recombinant codons for a different amino acid. Although likely to be scored as mutations, these recombinations would be much more frequent than true mutations. The advantage of connected synonymy is opposed by the disadvantage of these recombinational pseudomutations. Possible ways out of this paradox are discussed.},

abstract = {In numerous species, from bacteria to Drosophila, evidence suggests that selection acts even on synonymous codon usage: codon bias is greater in more abundantly expressed genes, the rate of synonymous evolution is lower in genes with greater codon bias, and there is consistency between genes in the same species in which codons are preferred. In contrast, in mammals, while nonequal use of alternative codons is observed, the bias is attributed to the background variance in nucleotide concentrations, reflected in the similar nucleotide composition of flanking noncoding and exonic third sites. However, a systematic examination of the covariants of codon usage controlling for background nucleotide content has yet to be performed. Here we present a new method to measure codon bias that corrects for background nucleotide content and apply this to 2396 human genes. Nearly all (99{\%}) exhibit a higher amount of codon bias than expected by chance. The patterns associated with selectively driven codon bias are weakly recovered: Broadly expressed genes have a higher level of bias than do tissue-specific genes, the bias is higher for genes with lower rates of synonymous substitutions, and certain codons are repeatedly preferred. However, while these patterns are suggestive, the first two patterns appear to be methodological artifacts. The last pattern reflects in part biases in usage of nucleotide pairs. We conclude that we find no evidence for selection on codon usage in humans.},

abstract = {Although changes in nucleotide sequence affecting the composition and the structure of proteins are well known, functional changes resulting from nucleotide substitutions cannot always be inferred from simple analysis of DNA sequence. Because a strong synonymous codon usage bias in the human DRD2 gene, suggesting selection on synonymous positions, was revealed by the relative independence of the G + C content of the third codon positions from the isochoric G + C frequencies, we chose to investigate functional effects of the six known naturally occurring synonymous changes (C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A) in the human DRD2. We report here that some synonymous mutations in the human DRD2 have functional effects and suggest a novel genetic mechanism. 957T, rather than being 'silent', altered the predicted mRNA folding, led to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation, and dramatically changed dopamine-induced up-regulation of DRD2 expression. 1101A did not show an effect by itself but annulled the above effects of 957T in the compound clone 957T/1101A, demonstrating that combinations of synonymous mutations can have functional consequences drastically different from those of each isolated mutation. C957T was found to be in linkage disequilibrium in a European-American population with the -141C Ins/Del and Taql 'A' variants, which have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and alcoholism, respectively. These results call into question some assumptions made about synonymous variation in molecular population genetics and gene-mapping studies of diseases with complex inheritance, and indicate that synonymous variation can have effects of potential pathophysiological and pharmacogenetic importance.},

@article{S.1996,
abstract = {Synonymous codon usage is biased and the bias seems to be different in different organisms. Factors with proposed roles in causing codon bias include degree and timing of gene expression, codon-anticodon interactions, transcription and translation rate and fidelity, codon context, and global and local G + C content. We offer a new perspective and new methods for elucidating codon choices applied especially to the human genome. We present data supporting the thesis that codon choices for human genes are largely a consequence of two factors: (1) amino acid constraints, (2) maintaining DNA structures dependent on base-step conformational tendencies consistent with the organism's genome signature that is determined by genome-wide processes of DNA modification, replication and repair. The related codon signature defined as the dinucleotide relative abundances at the distinct codon positions {\{}1, 2{\}}, {\{}2, 3{\}}, and {\{}3, 4{\}} (4 = 1 of the next codon) accommodates both the global genome signature and amino acid constraints. In human genes, codon positions {\{}2, 3{\}} and {\{}3, 4{\}} containing the silent site have similar codon signatures reflecting DNA symmetry. Strong CG and TA dinucleotide underrepresentation is observed at all codon positions as well as in non-coding regions. Estimates of synonymous codon usage based on codon signatures are in excellent agreement with the actual codon usage in human and general vertebrate genes. These properties are largely independent of the isochore compartment (G + C content), gene size, and transcriptional and translational constraints. We hypothesize that major influences on codon usage in human genes result from residue preferences and diresidue associations in proteins coupled to biases on the DNA level, related to replication and repair processes and/or DNA structural requirements.},
