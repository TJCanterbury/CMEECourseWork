# Welcome to Week3

## Directory Structure:

Sandbox is for personal fun and in the Data directory you will find files holding relevant data to the scripts in Code and for use in Sandbox
For the Code directory I will go into more detail.

### In Code you shall find:
 
 File       | Description
 ------------- | -------------
 apply1.R | Examples of how to use the apply function.
 apply2.R | More apply function examples.
 Autocorrelation.tex | Tex file for generating a report on an autocorrelation analysis of some temperature data.
