  Here I use model fitting to investigate the validity of the Sharpe-Schoolfield model as a mechanistic model of temperature performance curves 
  and find that it outperforms 2 phenomological models, the Briere model and a quadratic model.
  I believe that the evidence points towards the Sharpe-Schoolfield model being a viable mechanistic model, giving credence
  to metabolic theory, on the grounds that it outperforms 
  these phenomological models and that the parameter estimates remain within biologically realistic bounds whilst doing so. 
  However, the poor performance of the Briere model, with it being a non-linear 
  model designed for similar data, tells me a better non linear model is required for comparison - because otherwise 
  the Sharpe-Schoolfield model may simply be benefitting from being a good non-linear model with coincidentally believable 
  parameter values.

  \section{An Introduction} 
  The ecological importance of temperature across species can be seen in their numerous physiological, morphological and 
  behavioural adaptations for thermoregulation, from insects to marine mammals \cite{Castellini2018,Heinrich2009}, and in the effect of temperature
  on species distributions \cite{Woodward1988,Buckley}. To better anticipate and respond to the observed changes in climate \cite{RoyalSociety}
  we need a better understanding of the biotic feedback from changes in temperature, and of variation
  in tolerances between species to changes in temperature \cite{Buckley}. So the purpose of this report is to evaluate the performance of our best models
  for understanding this relationship.\\
  Across taxa there is a repeating pattern in the relationship between temperature and biological traits that we call a temperature performance curve (TPC). 
  It is believed by metabolic theorists that TPCs reflect the direct effects 
  of temperature on the biochemical reactions relevant to the trait measured and I'd argue the consistency in this relationship between taxa \cite{Dell2011a}, including 
  very simple organisms such as bacteria with well known policy implications in food hygeine \cite{Zwietering1991b}, suggests that this may be true. 
  It seems to be a fundamental feature of life on earth. \\
  The Sharpe-Schoolfield model is a mechanistic model that has been derived for the purpose of regressional 
  analysis of TPCs, under the assumption that they are the product of the behaviour of catalytic enzymes under different temperatures and that we can make 
  estimates of the parameters governing this behaviour through measurements of the shape of TPCs \cite{Schoolfield1981}. The shapes of enzymes are not 
  rigid and may denature at high temperatures and so reaction rate is sharply reduced. We see a more gentle decrease in performance at lower temperatures as the probability of a high energy collision 
  between reactant and enzyme decreases. We define the threshold energy requirement for successful reaction to be the activation energy; it is believed that
  one of the key roles of catalytic enzymes is to reduce this activation energy. \\ 
  I will use model fitting methods to evaluate the performance of the Sharpe-Schoolfield model incomparison to 2 phenomological models, one being a 
  generalised Briere model, which is non-linear; 
  and the other a simple quadratic model which is linear. I shall go into more detail about the nature of all 3 of these models in the models section. \\


  \section{The Data}
  The dataset I use broadly holds performance data for photosynthesis and respiration at different temperatures. 
  Photosynthesis and respiration are well understood, vital life processes governing transfers of energy, so very attractive traits for metabolic ecologists,
  and both have some of their reactants and products in the air making them relatively easy targets for study. There is considerable variance 
  in temperature range between IDs in the Dataset and so I examine the effect of this variation. 
  A large amount of IDs also have sample sizes below 6 
  and so these are excluded from the analysis, as a sample size of at least 6 is required to fit a Sharpe-Schoolfield model. \\
  The data also comes from different species, coming from different habitats. We might expect differences in the peak performance 
  temperatures between species depending on the particular ecologies of the different species but this is not the focus 
  of this report. \\
 
  \section{The Models}
  I built 3 models for comparison, one being a simple linear quadratic model, one being a Briere model and one being a Sharpe-Schoolfield model.\\
  Linear models are generally the easiest models to generate because there is only one optimal set of coefficients that will model the data. 
  Where we save in computational time and human effort we lose biological meaning (and delayed gratification?). The coefficients we generate 
  do not have any biological meaning other than that they describe the shape of the data. However we can still use this to find the optimum 
  temperature for the performance of a trait and gain a better understanding for the shape of the performance curves which for many ecological 
  applications is probably enough. If the fit is terrible not so much and its ability to describe the data regardless of fit is also 
  fundamentally limited because it cannot show any changes in rates of rates of change and so, for instance, plateaus towards either end of a 
  curve and skewness will be hidden by this model.\\
  Briere Model \cite{Brierea} is a phenomological, non linear model that was designed to take the shape of a temperature response curve, 
  specifically that of temperature dependent development rates of arthropods. It takes 4 parameters, the minimum (T\textsubscript{0}) and maximum (T\textsubscript{m}) 
  feasible temperatures of the trait and B\textsubscript{0} as a normalisation constant and m for generalising the shape for other sorts of temperature
  curve. With 2 of the parameters in this model being more biologically meaning and the shape of the curve being more custom for temperature
  performance curves you would expect this to perform better than a quadratic model.\\

  \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        B = \left\{
                \begin{array}{ll}
                    0 & \quad T \leq T_0 \\
                    B_0 T (T-T_0) \sqrt{T_m-T} & \quad T_0 \leq T \leq T_m \\
                    0 & \quad T \geq T_m
                \end{array}
            \right.
        \end{split}
  \end{equation}

  Sharpe-Schoolfield model \cite{Schoolfield1981} is one such mechanistic model grounded in biochemistry and 
  it describes temperature response curves in the following way. Metabolic reactions have an activation energy 
  (defined as E in the model), the threshold energy requirement for a collision between reactants to result in 
  a reaction. This threshold is lowered through catalytic enzymes which are reusable and so should reduce the 
  cost on the organism to release this energy from other sources, The activation . However, the shapes of enzymes 
  are not rigid and so at higher temperatures they can denature to the point of inactivation, this temperature is 
  defined as T\textsubscript{h} and the energy is defined as E\textsubscript{h} which are the Temperature and energy at which 50\% of enzyme units 
  are inactive on the hotter side of the curve. We see a more gentle decrease in performance at lower temperatures 
  as the probability of a high energy collision between reactants and enzymes decreases, the model represents this
  with T\textsubscript{l} and E\textsubscript{l}, which are the energy and temperature when the performance is at half on the cooler side of the 
  curve. B\textsubscript{0} is then the real rate performance of the trait at a reference temperature of 283.15 kelvin, 
  intended to normalise the curves for comparison. \\
  
  \begin{equation}
    B = \frac{B_0 e^{\frac{-E}{k} (\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{283.15})}}
    { 1 + e^{\frac{E_l}{k} (\frac{1}{T_l} - \frac{1}{T})} + 
    e^{\frac{E_h}{k} (\frac{1}{T_h} - \frac{1}{T})}}
  \end{equation}

  To estimate the performance of fit of each model, while taking into account the number of parameters used 
  I used the AIC scores of the models. This tells us the information loss for a given model's estimates of the data
  and takes into account the simplicity of the model, measured in number of parameters. I then calculated the 
  proportional difference between the best model for each dataset and the other models. 

  \section{The Results}
  I found that Schoolfield comes out on top in AIC but the overlap in performance between the models is considerable as shown in Figure 3. 
  In Figure 1 we see an example fit of ID 257 and you can see why Schoolfield 
  might be outperforming the other 2 models. It has a greater flexibility in shape due to the 
  additional parameters and in particular we can see it can do much sharper turns at the inflection point at 
  the peak of the curve. Figure 2 shows the probability that each model will give the best fit and we see that around 50\% of the time
  the Sharpe-Schoolfield Model wins which does not sound that impressive. \\
  Looking deeper into the data however reveals a possible reason, the Quadratic model performs particularly well when the data 
  occupies a smaller range of temperatures, which we see in figure 3. Clearly however the relationship between temperature range and
  the performances of the different models is not linear, clearly other variables must be having an effect. \\
  Looking at Figure 4, the best fit parameter values for 
  the Sharpe-Schoolfield model are usually not so different from the 
  mathematically estimated values and appear biologically plausible except for T\textsubscript{h} and T\textsubscript{l} 
  that show a bimodal distribution in the mathematically estimated parameter values. There is a consistency in best fit parameter values 
  around particular values, save for B\textsubscript{0} which we would expect to vary considerably so that the model will fit to 
  the different kinds of biological trait data being modelled.

  \section{Discussion}

  My code starts with estimated parameter values based on mathematical models of the data and 
  so the benefit of more complete data for the Schoolfield model may well be that it allows more 
  accurate estimation of these parameters. In particular estimation of B\textsubscript{0} is 
  difficult when there is a lack of low temperature data. I used temperature range as a simplistic way of measuring
  the completeness of the data but categorising the data by whether it had sufficient low temperature data or high temperature data 
  and categorising the overall shape of the curves using polynomial models would be useful for understanding why exactly temperature 
  range has the effect it does in this data.\\
  The performance of the Briere model is surprisingly low for it being a non-linear model designed
  for the modelling of temperature performance curves. We do see improved performance for more complete data but overall 
  a linear quadratic model performs better. The quadratic model benefits from having fewer parameters and 
  we would expect it to better model straight lines and other irregular temperature performance curves, 
  which you would expect to find amongst incomplete datasets. Still the poor performance of the Briere model is unhelpful for evaluating the performance of the 
  Sharpe-Schoolfield model. It may be that when the data is good Sharpe-Schoolfield wins, when the data is bad quadratic wins, 
  and Briere sits somewhere in the middle in either scenario.\\
  Whether the lack of alternative mechanistic models is indicative of a lack of possible alternative mechanisms 
  or an ignorance of the existence of such models, is not known to me. Using model fitting to determine whether a 
  model is mechanistic seems counterintuitive, for it does not tell me why the model fits the data, only that 
  it is better than alternative models, so it is important to have as many models as possible to compare. The alternative models 
  in this case are also only expected to be phenomological
  and so were never probable alternatives from the beginning however they do serve their role as indicators of the 
  performance of this model, as we would expect these phenomological models to outperform a false mechanistic model.\\
  These results do point towards the Sharpe-Schoolfield model being a viable mechanistic model, giving credence
  to metabolic theory, on the grounds that it outperforms 
  these phenomological models and that the parameter estimates remain within biologically realistic bounds whilst doing so. 
  However, the poor performance of the Briere model, with it being a non-linear 
  model designed for similar data, tells me a better non linear model is required for comparison - because otherwise 
  the Sharpe-Schoolfield model may simply be benefitting from being a good non-linear model with coincidentally believable 
  parameter values.
