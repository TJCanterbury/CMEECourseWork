abstract = {Biological temperature-dependent rate models based on Arrhenius' and Eyring's equations have been formulated by Johnson {\&} Lewin (1946), Hultin (1955), and Sharpe {\&} DeMichele (1977). The original formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele is poorly suited for non-linear regression. Very high correlations of parameter estimators occassionally make regression with their equation impossible using Marquardt's algorithm (1963). This analysis describes a new formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele's model that greatly alleviates the non-linear regression problem. It is partly based on Hultin's formulation (1955). Biological and graphical interpretation of the model parameters is discussed. Regression suitability is illustrated with a typical data set. Similar modifications to the equations of Hultin (1955) and Johnson {\&} Lewin (1946) are described. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {An understanding of the mechanisms by which temperature influences the distribution of species and vegetation has been attempted by modelling population growth and establishing those stages of the plant life cycle which, when diminished by extremes of temperature, for example, may have the greatest impact on plant survival. This analysis suggests that the heat sum of the growing season, measured as day-degrees, controls the distribution of annual vegetation. For perennial vegetation both the heat sum of the growing season and the annual, absolute minimum temperature are critical. Climatic correlations and experimental analyses indicate that, in northern Europe, the northern latitudinal and upper altitudinal limits of lowland and southern vegetation are directly controlled by climate. In contrast, the southern and lower altitudinal limits of upland and northern vegetation are likely to be controlled by temperature-sensitive competition with southern or lowland species. Many of the temperature-sensitive processes of plant growth and development, such as the non-linearity of extension growth and variations in the threshold temperatures of processes, may increase the realized heat sum at a particular geographical location. However, in more northerly climates, photoperiodic control is crucial in avoiding precocious development in the highly variable climatic conditions of early spring.},

abstract = {Thermal performance curves (TPCs) describe the effects of temperature on biological rate processes. Here, we use examples from our work on common killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to illustrate some important conceptual issues relating to TPCs in the context of using these curves to predict the responses of organisms to climate change. Phenotypic plasticity has the capacity to alter the shape and position of the TPCs for acute exposures, but these changes can be obscured when rate processes are measured only following chronic exposures. For example, the acute TPC for mitochondrial respiration in killifish is exponential in shape, but this shape changes with acclimation. If respiration rate is measured only at the acclimation temperature, the TPC is linear, concealing the underlying mechanistic complexity at an acute time scale. These issues are particularly problematic when attempting to use TPCs to predict the responses of organisms to temperature change in natural environments. Many TPCs are generated using laboratory exposures to constant temperatures, but temperature fluctuates in the natural environment, and the mechanisms influencing performance at acute and chronic time scales, and the responses of the performance traits at these time scales may be quite different. Unfortunately, our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of organisms to temperature change is incomplete, particularly with respect to integrating from processes occurring at the level of single proteins up to whole-organism functions across different time scales, which is a challenge for the development of strongly grounded mechanistic models of responses to global climate change. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {This chapter describes the thermoregulation in insects. It refers to the ability to regulate that body temperature which best serves survival and reproduction, and it encompasses numerous conflicting constraints and selective pressures. In insects, major considerations involve body mass and access to either external or internal heat. Thermoregulation operates through behavior, physiology, and morphology. For the most part, insects are too small to be able to appreciably elevate, or regulate their body temperature by internal heat production, although some are large enough and that, coupled with their high flight metabolism, could easily cause them to overheat. In numerous insects, elaborate mechanisms of thermoregulation have evolved both for heating and for cooling the body that possibly rival those of the typically endothermic vertebrates such as bees are able to raise their thoracic temperature by shivering, which can work their flight muscles harder than flight itself does, when coming back to their hives. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Synopsis Understanding the biological impacts of extreme temperatures requires translating meteorological estimates into organismal responses, but that translation is complex. In general, the physiological stress induced by a given thermal extreme should increase with the extreme's magnitude and duration, though acclimation may buffer that stress. However, organisms can differ strikingly in their exposure to and tolerance of a given extreme temperatures. Moreover, their sensitivity to extremes can vary during ontogeny, across seasons, and among species; and that sensitivity and its variation should be subject to selection. We use a simple quantitative genetic model and demonstrate that thermal extremes - even when at low frequency - can substantially influence the evolution of thermal sensitivity, particularly when the extremes cause mortality or persistent physiological injury, or when organisms are unable to use behavior to buffer exposure to extremes. Thermal extremes can drive organisms in temperate and tropical sites to have similar thermal tolerances despite major differences in mean temperatures. Indeed, the model correctly predicts that Australian Drosophila should have shallower latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance than would be expected based only on gradients in mean conditions. Predicting responses to climate change requires understanding not only how past selection to tolerate thermal extremes has helped establish existing geographic gradients in thermal tolerances, but also how increasing the incidence of thermal extremes will alter geographic gradients in the future.},

abstract = {The temperature of chilled foods is a very important variable for microbial safety in a production and distribution chain. To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of temperature on biological systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072 thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV.However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle - stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 ± 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the response of metabolic rate to temperature is essential for understanding thermal ecology and metabolic adaptation. Although the Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the effects of temperature on reaction rates and metabolic traits, it does not adequately describe two aspects of the thermal performance curve (TPC) for metabolic rate—that metabolic rate is a unimodal function of temperature often with maximal values in the biologically relevant temperature range and that activation energies are temperature dependent. We show that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate in ectotherms is well described by an enzyme-assisted Arrhenius (EAAR) model that accounts for the temperature-dependent contribution of enzymes to decreasing the activation energy required for reactions to occur. The model is mechanistically derived using the thermodynamic rules that govern protein stability. We contrast our model with other unimodal functions that also can be used to describe the temperature dependence of metabolic rate to show how the EAAR model provides an important advance over previous work. We fit the EAAR model to metabolic rate data for a variety of taxa to demonstrate the model's utility in describing metabolic rate TPCs while revealing significant differences in thermodynamic properties across species and acclimation temperatures. Our model advances our ability to understand the metabolic and ecological consequences of increases in the mean and variance of temperature associated with global climate change. In addition, the model suggests avenues by which organisms can acclimate and adapt to changing thermal environments. Furthermore, the parameters in the EAAR model generate links between organismal level performance and underlying molecular processes that can be tested for in future work.},

These models are easy to use and have 3 (equation 1) and 4 (equation 2) ecologically meaningful parameters, respectively. Each parameter can be estimated using nonlinear regression. These models were used to compare developmental rates at constant temperatures for our own experiments on Lobesia botrana (Dennis and Schiffermuller) and for data from 6 insect species described (a total of 13 stages). In all cases, we obtained an accurate nonlinear description of the rate of development against temperature given by the adjusted R2 (Kvalseth, 1985). The adjusted R2 calculated extended from 0.86 to 0.99 and were identical for our equations 1 and 2. In all cases, equation 2 provided the lowest residual sums of squares. The models gave upper T(L) and lower T0 temperature threshold estimations, and the estimations obtained were better by using equation 1 rather equation 2. Confidence intervals for each parameter were given and a comparison between estimated and observed temperature thresholds were presented.},
