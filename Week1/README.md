# Welcome to Week1
Challenges holds my answer to the bash command challenge, Sandbox is for personal fun and in the Data directory you will find files holding relevant data to the scripts in Code and for use in Sandbox
For the Code directory I will go into more detail.

### In Code you shall find a directory for each chapter of the book:

**In the UNIXScript dir you shall find the UnixPrac1.txt for completion of the FASTA exercise which does the following:**  
 **1**   Print how many lines for each file under the fasta directory  
 **2**   Print lines excluding line 1 for ecoli file, activate head if you don't want it all  
 **3**   Print count of pattern 'ATGC', excluding first lines and new lines  
 **4**   Calculates and prints AT/GC ratio  
  
**In the ShellScripts dir you shall find the following files:**
 Script       | Description
 ------------- | -------------
 UnixPrac1.txt |  **1** Print how many lines for each file under the fasta directory **2** Print lines excluding line 1 for ecoli file, activate head if you don't want it all **3** Print count of pattern 'ATGC', excluding first lines and new lines **4** Calculates and prints AT/GC ratio
