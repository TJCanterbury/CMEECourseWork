# Welcome
Hi, You've made it to my week 1 CMEE coursework.

## In Code you shall find a directory for each chapter of the book:

### In the UNIXScript dir you shall find the UnixPrac1.txt which does the following:
 1  Print how many lines for each file under the fasta directory
 2  Print lines excluding line 1 for ecoli file, activate head if you don't want it all
 3  Print count of pattern 'ATGC', excluding first lines and new lines
 4  Calculates and prints AT/GC ratio 

### In the ShellScripts dir you shall find the following files:
 Script       | Description
 ------------- | -------------
 boilerplate.sh | A boilerplate for all shell scripts
 ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh  | prints the concatenation of 2 given files
 CountLines.sh | prints the line count for a given file
 csvtospace.sh | converts a .csv into a space separated values file of a given name or otherwise the same name but with added extensions
 MyExampleScript.sh | says hello to user
 tabtocsv.sh | converts a tab separated values file into a .csv file
 tiff2mng.sh | converts a .tiff file into a .png file
 variables.sh | lets you set a variable and makes a variable through adding 2 given numerical values together

### In the LaTex dir you shall find the following files:
 CompileLaTeX.sh | which compiles a given .tex file and produces a pdf
 FirstBiblio.bib | which holds the bibliography for the FirstExample.tex file
 FirstExample.tex | which is my first .tex file, somewhat discusses Einstein

## In the data directory you will find relevant data to the above scripts such as .fasta files for the UNIXScript in the fasta dir, Temperatures files for use with the csvtospace.sh and spawannxs.txt which I simply used in the sandbox for practicing grep

## In challenges you will find my answer to the bash command challenge in the BashChallenge.txt

## Sandbox is for personal fun

## Results dir for output files of scripts with this functionality
