# Welcome to Week2

## Directory Structure:

Sandbox is for personal fun and in the Data directory you will find files holding relevant data to the scripts in Code and for use in Sandbox
For the Code directory I will go into more detail.

### In Code you shall find:
 
 Script       | Description
 ------------- | -------------
 align_seqs.py | Aligns 2 sequences from a given fasta file 
 align_seqs_fasta.py | Similar to align_segs.py except it takes sequences from 2 separate fasta files

 basic_csv | write a file containing only species name and Body mass
 basic_io1.py | prints lines from a file
 basic_io2.py | appends a file
 basic_io3.py | outputs dictionary to file
 boilerplate.py | boilerplate for python scripts
 cfexercises1.py | script holding various functions to demonstrate control flow
 cfexercises2.py | practice for loop scripts
 control_flow.py | python program for demonstrating control flow tools
 debugme.py | script with a bug
 dictionary.py | a short python script to populate a dictionary called taxa_dic derived from  taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa.
 lc1.py | list comprehensions
 lc2.py | further list comprehensions
 loops.py | further loops practice
 oaks_debugme.py | debugged program for finding oak species in a csv file
 oaks.py | further list comprehension practice
